(cnn) not long after her husband was killed in the mexican revolution, guadalupe fled north with her 1-year-old baby son in her arms. more than a century ago, she crossed the border and arrived in america without immigration documents -- or much else.

years later, her son salvador volunteered for and fought in world war ii, earned his citizenship through military service, and eventually opened a small business -- a barber shop in south los angeles. salvador was a dreamer before the term existed -- and he was my grandfather.

my family story isn't unique in this nation of immigrants. and today's dreamers -- who are american in every way except the papers they hold -- have the same potential and drive to serve their country as my grandfather.

but there's an important difference: young people brought to the us as children are confronting the prospect of deportation now from the only country they've ever really known.

this is not only cruel -- it's nonsensical.
