the nonpartisan race features a democrat and an independent

(cnn) a candidate in atlanta's mayoral race is calling for a recount after voters delivered a nearly split decision tuesday night.

mary norwood called for a recount minutes into wednesday as keisha lance bottoms celebrated the result. norwood cited an unofficial count in remarks before her supporters, and said while she was trailing her runoff opponent, she was waiting for further updates on the vote total later in the week.

earlier wednesday, april majors, a spokeswoman for fulton county, where most of the city is located, told cnn a recount would happen and was tentatively scheduled for saturday. but late wednesday morning, candice broce, a spokeswoman for the georgia secretary of state's office, told cnn the results hadn't yet been certified by either fulton or dekalb counties, the other county in which atlanta is located.

broce said monday is the last day for certification to occur. quinn hudson, a spokesperson for the dekalb county board of elections, said the results will be certified during the board's meeting on monday afternoon.

georgia law allows a second-place runoff candidate to request a recount if the difference between the two is under 1% of the vote total.
