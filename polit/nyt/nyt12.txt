to the editor:

re text and chat (if its o.k. with mom and dad) (front page, dec. 5):

when middle school students interact with one another online, its not always kind and supportive. as an advice columnist, i hear from too many girls who, for instance, feel pressured by boys to send nude photos on snapchat.

parents, please explain to your daughters why it would be crazy to send such photos. and please explain to your sons why it would be boorish and disrespectful to ask.

what kids need is more parent time, not more screen time. the formative years fly by.

look ahead. young children crave parental attention, but once kids become teenagers, its often mom and dad who wish that their sons and daughters had an extra hour for them.

hug your kids. talk to your kids. read to your kids. enjoy your kids. but think twice before setting up a facebook app for pre-teenagers or handing over a nifty device that offers the wide world, complete with bullies and manipulators.

childhood is short enough. why make it shorter?
