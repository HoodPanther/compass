to the editor:

re trump won, but lost his agenda, by henry olsen (op-ed, nov. 21):

what happened to donald trumps populist agenda? simple: he never had one. it was a scam to get elected. and it worked.

mr. trump, as president, is continuing to do what he has done his whole life: make rich people like him even richer.

expecting anything else is simply wishful thinking.
