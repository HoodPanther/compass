re president calls jerusalem shift the right thing  (front page, dec. 7):

president trump said all final status issues, like border issues in jerusalem, remain open to negotiation between the parties. so he may not have actually denied that jerusalem could be negotiated to be the capital of not only israel but also palestine: to be a shared capital.

this could decrease the high emotion on all sides, and would seem the most important question to ask him about where united states policy stands today on the israeli-palestinian conflict.

to the editor:

president trump, in his speech about jerusalem, called attention to president harry s. trumans recognition of the state of israel 70 years ago. but what truman did not do was to recognize jerusalem as its capital.

truman supported what we now call a two-state solution, a partition plan drawn up by the united nations. palestine would be divided into two separate states, one jewish and one arab. they would be tied together in an economic union.

as for jerusalem, an international zone would be established around the city to guarantee access by all faiths to their holy sites. jews welcomed the partition. the arabs did not. truman believed that was a great missed historic opportunity.
