re does mr. trump want mideast peace? (editorial, dec. 6):

the world does not get to choose a nations capital. that is the right of the sovereign nation.

instead of focusing on israels capital, the world needs to focus on palestinian incitement to violence and the palestinians refusal to recognize israels right to exist. when prime minister ehud olmert offered the palestinians 93 percent of the west bank and a piece of jerusalem as their capital in 2008, the arabs rejected the plan. why? because it allowed israel to continue its existence.

once the palestinians deal with the reality that israel exists, that it has a right to exist and that jerusalem is its capital, perhaps president mahmoud abbas can start real negotiations for the benefit of his people, as president anwar el-sadat of egypt did 38 years ago.

re trumps pledge over jerusalem rattles mideast (front page, dec. 6):

when you are unencumbered by history, advice and empathy, you get to make quick decisions that have a monumental effect on a part of the world that can erupt at any time. you get to make those decisions because it suits your short-term political desires.

surely, mr. president, you have made life more dangerous for your military and your diplomats in the region.

why decide to acknowledge jerusalem as the capital of israel with a vague promise to move our embassy there? did you receive anything of value in return? did you get a promise of movement toward peace in the region?

we know what you received. you got a chance to change the headline from your continuing troubles for 24 hours. if your decision results in violence against americans, your short-term decision will result in lifelong pain for the americans you swore to protect.
