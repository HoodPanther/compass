today, china is an upper-middle-income country where per capita g.d.p. is close to $9,000 a year, and that figure is likely to cross the $12,700 threshold, the hallmark of a high-income country, around 2025. china is also the worlds largest producer of goods, and one of the most competitive countries in the world.

and china embraces globalization. the country has championed the ambitious belt and road initiative, which proposes to connect it with markets in asia, europe and africa through infrastructure development. despite open opposition from the united states at its inception, the asian infrastructure investment bank, proposed by china as a vehicle for the belt and road initiative, has 77 member countries today, making it one of the largest multilateral development institutions in the world.

in 2015, the renminbi was listed as one of five currencies in the international monetary funds special drawing rights basket, alongside the american dollar, the japanese yen, the euro and the british pound. this designation moved the renminbi one step closer to becoming an international reserve currency.

it is worth noting that after embarking on their own economic transitions, the former soviet union and eastern europe both suffered economic collapses, while china has seen much more success. the primary reason has been a difference in approach.

in the transitions early years, china had a large number of nonviable state-owned enterprises in capital-intensive industries, such as heavy-equipment manufacturing and steelmaking. in the open and competitive market, such industries could not have survived without protection and subsidies. therefore the chinese government subsidized these enterprises, but opened up investment in labor-intensive industries, in which china enjoyed comparative advantages. this dual-track approach allowed china to maintain stability and achieve rapid development.

a similar strategy was applied to opening up chinas broader economy. china restricted the inflow of foreign capital to capital-intensive industries, which consisted mainly of state-owned enterprises. labor-intensive industries, on the other hand, were opened up to attract foreign investment.

the dual-track transition came at a cost. market intervention and distortion gave rise to corruption and inequitable distribution of income. pollution worsened with the rapid development of manufacturing. to cope with these issues, during his first five-year period as national leader between 2012-17, president xi jinping engaged the assistance of his ally wang qishan in a sweeping anticorruption drive; proposed allowing the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation by eliminating the distortions of the dual-track reform; and advocated for tight environmental regulation, which would balance high growth and green growth.

the nation will continue to pursue programs that eliminate poverty and hunger, not only within its own borders but also around the world. instead of following the western practice of imposing its values and ideologies on other developing countries as a precondition for humanitarian aid, china will continue to offer aid, trade and investment opportunities to developing countries while adhering to a principle of noninterference.
