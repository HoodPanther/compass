to the editor:

re open letter urges removal of monuments (arts briefing, dec. 5):

perhaps the controversy over statues of flawed historical figures presents a teaching moment.

rather than remove them, why not install plaques providing information about the historical figures, acknowledging their faults as well as their accomplishments, in the context of their time and contrasted with the context of the present?

presenting a more complete account on each statue would enlighten the public by providing a more accurate picture of historical figures.
