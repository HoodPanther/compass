the secretary of state said trump was very committed to the peace process, adding that the team led by trumps son-in-law and senior adviser jared kushner was working very diligently to achieve it.

speaking alongside tillerson after a meeting in brussels, british foreign secretary boris johnson called for the us administration to present a mideast peace plan quickly following trumps move.

he did not comment directly on the expected announcement, saying that the uk will have to wait and see what trump says in his speech later on wednesday.

but johnson said the decision clearly makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited american proposals on the middle east peace process are now brought forward.

he said that should happen as a matter of priority.

meanwhile, turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said the whole world is against trumps move and argued that moving the embassy to jerusalem would be a grave mistake.

cavusoglu made his remarks just before meeting with tillerson.

he said such a move would not bring any stability, peace but rather chaos and instability.
