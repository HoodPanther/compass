doug jones argued in november that repealing and replacing obamacare is just a slogan and does not serve as a viable option to solving americas healthcare problems.

jones said, repeal and replace is a political slogan. its not something thats workable.

the democratic candidate for the u.s. senate added that he believes that the affordable care act was always meant to serve as a work in progress.

the affordable care act was never supposed to be the end of the discussion about health care in this country, jones argued. it is always going to be a work in progress.

doug jones promised to fix obamacare rather than repeal the affordable care act. jones admitted, if its broken, fix it. health care, its broken. you know it and i know it. but roy moores grandstanding and extreme views will do nothing to fix it and his policies will take us back to the past.

alabama judge roy moore has promised that if elected, he will work to fully repeal obamacare.

the roy moore campaign explained in a press release, federal intrusion into our healthcare system has stifled the free market, lowered the quality of healthcare, and raised the cost of premiums for consumers. in the united states senate, judge roy moore will put forth a plan to repeal both obamacare and the mccarran-ferguson act of 1945. every day americans will have the best access to health care at the best cost when the federal government steps out and the free market steps in. for small businessmen and women and consumers, the clear choice for the u.s. senate is judge roy moore.
