according to the washington posts sean sullivan, sen. corey booker (d-nj) is expected to campaign on behalf of democratic u.s. senate hopeful doug jones on sunday in birmingham, al.

sullivan reports rep. terri sewell (d-al), the states lone democratic member of the house of representatives, is spearheading the effort to bring some high-profile african-american democrats to the yellowhammer state, including the booker and rep. john lewis (d-ga). he also reports events that include former gov. deval patrick (d-ma), rep. cedric l. richmond (d-la) and rep. sanford d. bishop jr. (d-ga) are in the works as well.

terri sewell has invited some of her friends and colleagues down to help, and we look forward to the weekend, giles perkins, the chairman of the jones campaign, said to the post.

the effort by sewell showcases the desire of the jones campaign to drive up turnout in the african-american communities, which will be necessary for the democrat to defeat his republican opponent former alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore.

a democrat hasnt won a major statewide office in alabama since the 2006 election cycle, and this is perceived to be the best shot for democrats to do so in recent memory. polling has been mixed for jones and moore, giving each of them single-digit leads for the december 12 contest. however, the real clear politics average of polls shows moore with a 2.3-point advantage over jones.
