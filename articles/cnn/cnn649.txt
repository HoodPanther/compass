researchers think making hiv testing available through mobile tech can prevent virus' spread

(cnn) grindr, a dating app for gay men, was found to be an effective way to give out hiv self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of hiv, according to a recent study.

the study targeted black and hispanic grindr users in los angeles, a high-risk population that is often untested for hiv.

gay-related and hiv-related stigma and lack of access to health care often keep these men from getting tested, according to dr. a. lina rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the university of north carolina, chapel hill. the study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.

with a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. if the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.

researchers offered free access to these hiv home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on grindr. clicking on the ads took users to the study's website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. they were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.
