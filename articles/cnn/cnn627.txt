story highlights defector shot by north korean military across dmz found to have parasitic worms

experts say the soldier's health indicates poor living conditions in north korea

(cnn) parasitic worms and a chronic liver infection identified in a north korean soldier who dramatically defected are providing clues into health conditions inside the secretive rogue state, experts said wednesday.

the soldier was shot up to five times november 13 while making a run for the south korean side of the border through the heavily fortified demilitarized zone, according to dramatic security video released this week.

north korean soldiers fired at him about 40 times, hitting him with bullets from both pistols and an ak-47, violating the armistice agreement between the two countries after the korean war, the un command said.

the defector, whose last name is oh, required emergency treatment for his wounds, including extensive surgery. doctors discovered a large number and multiple forms of parasitic worms.

some of the parasites removed were as long as 27 centimeters (more than 10 inches), according to the south korean doctors who treated him. one type of worm they discovered is typically found in dogs.
