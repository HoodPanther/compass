(cnn)  old delhi, mumbai , rajasthan, the himalayas -- india is full of contrasts and layers, diverse landscapes and notoriously hard-to-reach villages.

"the palace hotel experience in rajasthan, in particular, is something you don't see anywhere else in the world," jay tindall, co-founder of ultra-luxury bespoke travel service remote lands , tells cnn travel.

"it's really uniquely india and it tends to be the starting point for luxury travelers. that's a challenge for us as well, because we encourage visitors to get off the beaten track and explore more of the country."

once you decide which destinations to visit, the next decision is where to stay. from palace hotels to luxury tented camps, these are india's crme de la crme:

set in the middle of lake pichola -- in india's storied udaipur region -- taj lake palace has long been praised as one of the world's most romantic hotels.

it's almost hard to believe your eyes. the white marble marvel appears to float above the water, all the while surrounded by the majestic aravalli mountains.

"if you want that more-than-250-year-old history, you'll find it at a taj hotel," says tindall. "this is where taj really shines. the service is impeccable, and they are all special properties where you can feel a sense of history at the centuries-old palaces."

it's an opulent experience from start to finish, beginning with a boat ride to the royal island, where guests are immediately welcomed with a shower of rose petals and a welcome drink.

from there, travelers can lounge around in 18th-century splendor -- originally built as a pleasure palace by maharana jagat singh ii in 1746 -- dine on authentic rajasthani cuisine, or book a treatment on the famous spa boat.

rambagh palace

featuring white marble corridors and red brick accents, the rambagh palace was used by the maharajas of jaipur in various capacities over the years, first as a handmaid's residence then a hunting lodge and finally a royal guesthouse.

the hotel offers countless ways to unwind, including two pools, a grand spa, a polo bar, boutique shops, and a labyrinth of romantic courtyards.

during the day, guests are invited to take a historical walk about the grounds escorted by a palace butler and, by night, the palace's front lawns come alive with performances and music.

"the one thing india really does exceptionally well is service -- it's the entire experience," says tindall. "from the moment you walk in the door, it's very regal, detail-oriented, personable ... and you just get this sense of colonial-influenced old india."
