massimo bottura, chef patron of the michelin three-starred restaurant osteria francescana , is a man of many pleasures: food, naturally, but also art and jazz , which have famously inspired some of his most striking dishes.

but for this aesthete, similar pleasures can be found behind the wheel of a car -- particularly when the car in question is a vintage maserati ghibli spyder, one of only 125 ever made.

"driving a car like this to me is really special because i am one of the few very lucky to have the opportunity to drive such a rare car," said bottura, who brought cnn style along for a ride through his hometown of modena, italy. "it's emotional, like listening to miles davis whispering in a trumpet."

but the joy of the road is nothing new for bottura. he still remembers standing along the same streets as a child, watching and listening to the passing cars and motorcycles. "coming back to modena in a province in this small town, they keep you grounded," bottura said.

"it's another secret of how my life stayed so easy and simple: you never have to lose the perception of who you are and where you come from."
