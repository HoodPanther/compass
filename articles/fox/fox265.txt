a website is being called offensive for its advertisements for plus-size tights, which feature petite models being engulfed by the pantyhose to demonstrate each pair's capacity to stretch.

there are several of the ads, which have circulated around the internet, and they all show a slender woman posing inside of large tights. many of them include the model pulling the tights up to her shoulders or past her chin.

in one of the body-shaming ads, a thin model is seen standing in one leg of the plus-size tights, showing how roomy they are.

this isnt the first time wish.com has been criticized. the website has been critiqued in the past for its business practices.

wish targets customers with low-price goods such as dresses, watches, sneakers or jewelry shipped straight from chinese manufacturers  but that also means delivery can take weeks and items sometimes arrive damaged, reports recode.
