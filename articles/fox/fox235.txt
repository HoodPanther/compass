unless the cultures critics get a hearing, the forces that led to weinstein will win.

by daniel henninger, the wall street journal



the harvey weinstein sexual-harassment fire burns on, consuming famous men. corporations and institutions are on automated rapid response: proclaim zero tolerance and throw offenders into the street, while directing human-resources departments to design fine-grained standards of acceptable behavior.

it would be a comfort to think that hr specialists could solve this problem, but what has gone wrong runs deeper than calling in the lawyers. a question persists: how did this happen?

how have so many intelligent, accomplished adult men crashed across the boundaries of sex? psychiatric explanationsreducing cause to a uniquely individual neurosisare insufficient. this isnt just really weird stuff.

some may have a distant memory of the culture wars of the 1990s. this looks like a moment to revisit some of its battlefields.

incidents of sexual abuse on this scale dont randomly erupt. they grow from the complex climate of a nations culture. these guys arent blips or outliers. these men are a product of their times.

their acts reveal a collapse of self-restraint. that in turn suggests a broader evaporation of conscience, the sense that doing something is wrong. we are seeing now how wrongs can hurt others when conscience is demoted as a civilizing instrument of personal behavior.
