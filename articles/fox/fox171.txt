is michael flynn going to cut a deal and throw donald j. trump under the bus?

on wednesday's show, fox news senior judicial analyst judge andrew napolitano joined tom shillue to discuss the latest on the russian probe!

based on recent meetings between flynn's lawyers and the government, the judge believes it's very possible flynn -- trump's former adviser who is in a lot of legal trouble -- may have made a deal with mueller's russian probe.

the judge says flynn could be facing up to 60 years for crimes that include lying to the fbi and the general may be willing to dish any dirt on the president or anyone close to him if it keeps him out of prison.
