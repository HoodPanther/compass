the companys founder, evan hafer said his coffee is becoming very popular among conservatives.

progressives hate me and conservatives love me. so if youre pro-american, pro-america youre going to love my coffee, hafer told fox business maria bartiromo on mornings with maria.

the former army special forces vet started roasting coffee in 2006 so he could have fresh coffee while deployed in iraq and afghanistan. hafer said his passion for coffee, coupled with his military experience, is how black rifle was created.

the black rifles we carry in the military, they are life-saving equipment  however, progressives were villainizing and making this name black rifles  they were just saying the most atrocious things about them, he said. so i thought, okay, heres something that i can do, which is, these are my two passions and im going to fuse them together. at the same time, ill just alienate and make a stand and tell people exactly where we are at.

hafer added there is a 50% hire ratio for veterans and more than 200 years of combined military service at black rifle coffee.
