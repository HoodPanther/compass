the gains were widespread, and telecom and health care stocks helped lead the way. overseas markets were also higher after negotiators hit a breakthrough in the united kingdom's efforts to leave the european union.

the s&p 500 rose 14.52 points, or 0.6 percent, to finish at 2,651.50, another record. the dow jones industrial average gained 117.68, or 0.5 percent, to 24,329.16, and the nasdaq composite rose 27.24, or 0.4 percent, to 6,840.08.

the u.s. jobs report, which is the economic highlight of each month, showed that employers added 228,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.1 percent. it's the latest evidence that the u.s. economy continues to improve, in sync with the rest of the world.

technology stocks in the s&p 500 rose 0.4 percent. the industry has been the market's biggest winner this year, but it had stumbled recently as investors moved out of tech stocks and into companies seen as benefiting more from washington's push to overhaul the tax code, such as financial companies and retailers. the pullback was short-lived, and tech stocks erased their losses for the week.

another potential source of worry for investors dissipated after congress passed a spending bill that will prevent a government shutdown this weekend. the deal keeps the government running only until dec. 22, though, when another deadline looms.
