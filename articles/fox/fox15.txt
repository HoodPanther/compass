how is it possible that hillary clinton escaped criminal indictment for mishandling classified documents despite incriminating evidence that she violated the espionage act?

why did donald trump become the target of a criminal investigation for allegedly conspiring with russia to influence the presidential election despite no evidence that he ever did so?

the answer, it seems, comes down to one person who played a vital role in both cases: peter strzok, deputy director of counterintelligence at the fbi.

strzok was exchanging politically charged texts with an fbi lawyer that denigrated trump and lauded clinton at the same time he was leading the bureaus criminal investigation of clinton. he is also the one who changed the critical wording of then-fbi director james comeys description of clintons handling of classified material that resulted in no charges being brought against her.

then, strzok reportedly signed the document launching the 2016 investigation into russias meddling in the election and whether the trump campaign played any role. after leading the fbis probe into trump, he then joined robert muellers special counsel team as an integral investigator.

thus, it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing clinton and accusing trump, evidence be damned.

and then he was caught.

the strzok bust and cover-up

the department of justice inspector general, michael horowitz, discovered the electronic texts strzok exchanged with his lover, fbi lawyer lisa page. the messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of muellers investigation that strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team, where he was a pivotal participant.
