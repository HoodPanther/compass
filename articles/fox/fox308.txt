"randys behavior was extremely altered the evening of his arrest due to the state of his mental health, and substances in his body, causing him to do and say things that were entirely out of character," travis' rep told fox news. "he suffered a severe concussion and sustained numerous other injuries from the crash."

travis' statement continued, "randy is deeply apologetic for his actions that evening. a man of integrity with a good heart, randy does not and will never condone these types of actions that distort the true beliefs of randy travis and his entire family."

travis was reportedly belligerent and confused at the time and went as far as to threaten the arresting officers with death. his blood-alcohol level was later tested at a 0.21, more than double the legal limit to drive. a dashboard camera reportedly caught the whole incident, which would normally be a matter of public record.

travis has made three attempts to prevent the tape from hitting the public. he has been battling health issues since suffering a stroke in 2013.
