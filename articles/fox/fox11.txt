fox's jared halpern has more from capitol hill:

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says he's had no change of heart about alabama republican senate candidate roy moore:

(mcconnell) "i had hoped earlier he would withdraw as a candidate. that obviously is not going to happen."

but mcconnell says, should moore win next week's special election, he would immediately face a senate ethics committee investigation.

president trump has fully endorsed moore, despite allegations from several women of sexual misconduct by moore when he was in his 30's and they were teenagers.
