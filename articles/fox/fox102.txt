anheuser-busch is going electric.

the beer brewing giant has placed an order for 40 of teslas new electric semis.

the battery-powered trucks unveiled in november have a range of up to 500 miles between charges and a starting price of $200,000.

tesla says they will be the quickest big rigs on the road and feature various autonomous capabilities.

anheuser-busch joins walmart, j.b. hunt and a growing list of companies putting their names on the list for the trucks, which are scheduled to enter production sometime in 2019.

last year anheuser-busch teamed up with autonomous outfit otto to deliver a load of budweiser across colorado in a self-driving diesel semi.

at anheuser-busch, we are constantly seeking new ways to make our supply chain more sustainable, efficient, and innovative, wrote james sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy. this investment in tesla semi-trucks helps us achieve these goals while improving road safety and lowering our environmental impact.
