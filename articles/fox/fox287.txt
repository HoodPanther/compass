shenzhen-based tencent is one of china's most powerful internet companies, running the wechat messaging app as well as online payment platforms and games. because chinese authorities have largely shut out western companies like google, twitter and facebook, homegrown internet companies like tencent have been able to grow rapidly in size.

spotify, meanwhile, has no users in china. according to the company, spotify as of july had over 60 million subscribers and 140 million active users who can access to over 30 million songs.
