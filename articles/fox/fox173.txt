on monday, kellyanne conway, counselor to the president, joined the tom shillue show to discuss president donald trump's historic decision to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and move the us embassy there.

democrats, the arab world and other members of the global community were quick to criticize the president for his historic announcement-- but kellyanne conway wasn't having of it.

conway called out democrats, who have been critical of the president's decision, claiming they have always recognized jerusalem as the capital when running for office, but are now only opposing the president for political reasons. she also pointed out that former presidents have been promising this for decades, but trump was the only president to keep that promise.

regarding threats of violence after the president's announcement, conway predicted that the media will likely blame trump if anyone gets hurt. of course, she argued, that wouldn't make it true and the president is always concerned about the security of americans.

conway also mocked the house democrats "embarrassing" impeachment vote.
