former attorney general eric holder and ex-fbi director james comey fired back sunday at president trump, who claimed the fbis reputation is in tatters after its handling of the hillary clinton email investigation.

nope. not letting this go. the fbis reputation is not in 'tatters,' holder, who served as attorney general under president obama, tweeted. its composed of the same dedicated men and women who have always worked there and who do a great, apolitical job.

holder added, youll find integrity and honesty at fbi headquarters and not at 1600 penn ave right now, referring to the white house.

trump earlier sunday said that after years of comey, with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation (and more), running the fbi, its reputation is in tatters  worst in history! but fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.

the presidents tweet followed news that fbi agent peter strzok was removed from special counsel robert muellers investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia because of anti-trump text messages he may have sent.
