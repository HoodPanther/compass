olympic gold medal skier lindsey vonn says she'll represent the united states, but not president trump, when she returns to the winter games in february.

vonn, who won a gold medal in the womens downhill competition in 2010 in vancouver, skipped the 2014 sochi games because of knee injuries.

i hope to represent the people of the united states, not the president, vonn said this week amid the buildup to the 2018 games in pyeongchang, south korea.

i take the olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremonies, she added.

i want to represent our country well, and i dont think there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that.

vonn also told cnn that she would absolutely not accept an invitation to the white house.
