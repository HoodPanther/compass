at a thursday press conference, sen. al franken is expected to announce hes stepping down in the wake of an ever-growing list of credible sexual-harassment allegations.

his exit became inevitable wednesday after new yorks own sen. kirsten gillibrand, followed by six other female senate democrats, called on him to resign  and the total quickly grew to dozens of senators of his own party, as well as democratic national committee chief tom perez.

whether the trigger was yet another woman stepping up to accuse franken that morning, or maureen callahans eloquent plea in wednesdays post, frankens colleagues have plainly had enough.

some note that his exit is also the best way for his party to hold the seat: though franken wasnt up for re-election until 2020, the scandals have sent his popularity sinking.

he wouldve been dead meat in a highly competitive state. now minnesotas democratic governor can appoint a temporary replacement who can run as the incumbent in the special election next year (likely a strong year for democrats) to fill out the term.
