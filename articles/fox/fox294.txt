while promoting her book in china this week, hillary clinton took time to criticize donald trump and his approach to north korea.

on the tom shillue show, fox news' chris stirewalt shared his insight on hillary clinton's "pitiful" book tour and the "new judgment" forming "among democrats and across the spectrum about the clintons."

stirewalt told tom that clinton's behavior since the election has been an assault on our democratic norms. he also thinks the clinton's legacies have taken a severe hit in recent months and will likely live their last days on earth as pariahs.
