youtube is taking steps to crack down on videos that violate its policies.

fox's steve rappoport has the story:

youtube ceo susan wojcicki says some "bad actors" are exploiting the video-sharing site to mislead, manipulate harass or even harm others.

parent company google will have more than 10,000 workers monitoring content by next year to address the problem.

youtube already relies on machine learning technology to remove violent extremist videos and will expand its use to flag videos and comments that contain hate speech or harm to children.

several advertisers reportedly pulled ads in recent weeks because of videos containing questionable content.
