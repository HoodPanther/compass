the u.s. senate voted just before 2 a.m. et saturday to pass a sweeping tax overhaul worth roughly $1.4 trillion, putting the trump white house a big step closer to its first major legislative victory  and many americans closer to a tax cut.

the vote was 51-49, with republican bob corker of tennessee the only member of the gop to side with the democrats in opposition.

not long after the vote, president donald trump tweeted his reaction:

"we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america," the president wrote. "special thanks to @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and chairman @senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate. look forward to signing a final bill before christmas!"



house minority leader nancy pelosi, d-calif., also responded, calling the legislation a "betrayal of the american middle class."

the gop tax scam is a product of haste, carelessness and cruelty," pelosi wrote. "it was written on republicans trickle-down delusions, not analysis or facts. it was written first and foremost for the wealthiest one percent, not middle class families trying to get ahead."
