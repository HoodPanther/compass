michael flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi and is allegedly cooperating with mueller's russia probe.

democrats are gleeful.

but before the left starts planning trump's impeachment, one of the country's top legal experts still wants to know what actual crime trump or anyone in his inner circle actually broke!

hours after the news broke about michael flynn pleading guilty of lying to the fbi and possibly 'cooperating' with robert mueller's russia probe, harvard law professor emeritus alan dershowitz joined the tom shillue to give his take.

dershowitz called flynn indictment was the strangest he's ever seen, partly because the crime he plead guilty to was lying about something that wasn't illegal. as many legal experts have pointed out, it would have been entirely appropriate for flynn or any trump associate to reach out to the russians.

however, he lied to the fbi about it and got himself in serious trouble.

even when it comes to russia collusion in the 2016 election, the very thing mueller is supposed to be focused on, dershowitz believes there isn't even a crime one the books to charge trump if it can be proven he worked with the russians to help him get elected.
