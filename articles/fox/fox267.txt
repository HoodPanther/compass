well, thats a deal-breaker.

berry ng, a 22-year-old youtube star from hong kong, has had more than 30 plastic surgery procedures in the past five years  all to impress her (now ex-) boyfriend.

she says she started going under the knife because her ex criticized her looks and kept comparing her to supermodels, reports next shark.

ng has spent more than $3,000 augmenting her forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, chin and breasts.

but that still wasnt enough to impress her critical beau.

at that moment, if he had stopped me and told me that i was beautiful enough, i would have stopped, but he didnt, she said.

even after all of her operations, he still didnt like her breasts. so she got them augmented last year.

when ngs mother saw her after that last operation, she started crying. in that moment, ng realized her plastic surgery obsession had gotten out of control.

shes since dumped the deadbeat and has told local media outlets she regrets her surgeries and wants to encourage body positivity going forward.
