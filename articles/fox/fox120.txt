congress is facing a friday deadline to prevent a government shutdown.

fox's jared halpern has more from capitol hill:

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is backing a two-week spending bill, time, he says to reach agreement on larger issues:

(mcconnell) "that the caps are gonna be and the other provisions that are gonna be part of the year-end spending measure."

one of those issues is a daca-fix, designed to reinstate deportation protections for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children:

(schumer) "there are good negotiations occurring between democrats and republicans to come up with a good daca program as well as some good border security."

senate democratic leader chuck schumer and other top congressional leaders will meet with the president thursday afternoon to discuss ways to keep the government funded.
