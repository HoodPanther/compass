if you are inclined to commit a heinous crime, san francisco is the place for you.

you can sneak into city hall armed with a .38-caliber revolver, murder the mayor and a supervisor in cold blood, and get away with it. all you need to do is conjure some preposterous defense. blame it on an excessive consumption of junk food like twinkies and you can beat the rap. you know eat a twinkie and commit murder. a san francisco jury will lap it up.so, it should come as no surprise that the killer of kate steinle was acquitted thursday of murder and involuntarily manslaughter.

jose ines garcia zarate and his lawyers invented a ludicrous defense by claiming the gun just went off by itself, ending the life of a 32-year-old woman who was walking along a pier with her father. it was a perfect defense for a notoriously liberal city  guns kill, not people. sure enough, the san francisco jury swallowed it hook, line and sinker.
