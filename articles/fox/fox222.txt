oregon state university is moving forward to rename some campus buildings despite thin or even contradictory evidence that their namesakes were connected to slavery.

president ed ray announced the decision last week, giving an extended overview of the universitys scholarly research on arnold dining center, avery lodge, benton hall, benton annex and gill coliseum, three of which are to be renamed.

though student protests against some of the building names took place this spring, at the time the administration claimed a review process had been underway for nearly a year.

the actual renaming process will begin early next year and the new names will debut during the universitys 150th anniversary in october, ray told the community.
