deputy national security adviser dina powell plans to leave the trump administration early next year, the white house announced friday.

in a brief statement, press secretary sarah sanders called powell a "trusted adviser," saying she always planned to serve only one year before returning to new york.

sanders said powell will "continue to support the president's agenda and work on middle east policy."

national security adviser h.r. mcmaster said in a statement that powell "has been an invaluable member of president trump's team" who "drove an effort to restore our nation's strategic competence."

he said: "all of us look forward to continuing to work with her, as she continues to support this administration's efforts on middle east peace and other issues."

powell was originally hired to work on economic development at the behest of trump's daughter, ivanka trump, and his son-in-law jared kushner. but the egyptian-american with international experience and fluency in arabic was soon moved to the national security council.

powell's foreign policy experience was forged under condoleezza rice, who brought her into the state department when the george w. bush's administration was trying to improve diplomacy in the middle east.

born in cairo, powell moved to the united states with her family at the age of four and had to learn to speak english. entering republican politics at a young age, powell put herself through the university of texas by working in the state legislature.
