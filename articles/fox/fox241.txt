"this is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality, president trump said in announcing americas recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel. never have truer words been spoken, and they were delivered in the best speech trump has ever given.

what trump did was stunning. he could just have signed the waiver of the law passed in 1995 compelling the executive branch to move americas embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem. he did it six months ago, just like his three immediate predecessors did every six months since 1996. or he could have not signed the waiver and simply said he was going to start the process of building the new embassy.

instead, he called the international communitys seven-decade bluff and ended a delusion about the future that has prevented palestinians from seeing the world and their own geopolitical situation clearly. it is a bold shift.

the idea that jerusalem is not israels capital has been a global pretense for decades, including here in the united states. its a pretense because jerusalem has been israels capital from the moment the new country secured a future by winning a bloody war for independence waged against it by arab nations after they rejected the un partition of the old british mandate into a jewish state and an arab state.

under the plan, jerusalem was to be an international city governed by the united nations. but the arab effort to push the jews into the sea  an effort no other nation on earth intervened in to prevent  left a divided jerusalem in the hands of the jews in the west and jordan in the east.
