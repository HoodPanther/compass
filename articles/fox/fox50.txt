"i figured an officer in my community, who comes into my restaurant and eats all the time, i have to help them and give support," said grimm of oconnor, who has served the greater st. louis area for nearly 20 years and remains hospitalized in critical condition.

soon after learning that o'connor had been shot, grimm began asking his drive-thru customers for pennies while he was preparing their orders at the tex-mex franchises arnold location. but patrons were much more generous  and grimm soon had a piggy bank overflowing with donations.

"i got a lot of ashtray change. i got dollars, five dollars and other bills given to me. it was just a remarkable thing to see people give in a time of need," grimm said of his collection.

describing oconnor as very mellow, nice and considerate, grimm feels hes simply doing his part to give back to the law enforcement official who has given so much, sharing that oconnor once helped him search for a felon who chased him in a car and threw a bottle at his mothers window.
