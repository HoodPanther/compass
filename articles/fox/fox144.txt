president trump on monday endorsed alabama republican senate nominee roy moore, telling voters "we need" him to tackle illegal immigration, tax reform and more -- after weeks of holding back his full support for the embattled candidate. the white house made it official in a statement confirming trump personally backed moore during a phone call. "the president had a positive call with judge roy moore during which they discussed the state of the alabama senate race and the president endorsed judge moore's campaign," principal deputy press secretary raj shah said. moments earlier, moore tweeted that trump had given his support and told him: "go get 'em, roy!" not everyone is on board though.

also, the log cabin republicans, the nation's premier republican organization representing lgbt conservatives and straight allies has come out with a new ad calling on christians to act on their morals and "stand up against the theocratic demagogue" that they consider united states senate candidate roy moore to be. "roy moore has spent his entire career using his bigoted brand of christianity as a weapon to relentlessly attack members of the lgbt community, all the while allegedly preying upon the most vulnerable in our society," said gregory t. angelo, president of the log cabin republicans.

bryan fischer, host of focal point on american family radio and gregory t. angelo, president of the log cabin republicans, joined the todd starnes show to debate the roy moore allegations and discuss why they do and do not support him, respectively. listen to the full interview below:
