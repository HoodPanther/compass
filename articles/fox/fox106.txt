this is a tale of fbi power misused and presidential trust misplaced.

last week, retired lt. gen. michael flynn, president donald trumps confidant on matters pertaining to national security from june 2015 to february 2017 and his short-lived national security adviser in the white house, pleaded guilty in federal court in washington, d.c., to a single count of lying to the fbi. under the terms of his plea agreement, flynn, who had faced nearly 60 years in federal prison had he been convicted of charges related to all the matters about which there is said to be credible evidence of his guilt, will now face six months.

what could have caused robert mueller, the no-nonsense special counsel investigating whether any americans aided the russian government in its now well-known interference in the 2016 american presidential election, to have given flynn such an extraordinary deal?

here is the back story.

during the fbis investigation of russian meddling in the election, it became interested in flynns communications with sergey kislyak, a kgb colonel (the kgb is now known by its post-soviet acronym, fsb) masquerading as the russian ambassador to the u.s.

after trump won the presidency, flynn became an important member of the presidential transition team. between the election and the inauguration, flynn spoke on the telephone with kislyak five times. because kislyak was a foreign spy, as well as an ambassador, his communications with americans were monitored by the fbi.

when flynn agreed to be interviewed by the fbi in his west wing office on jan. 24, he probably did not know what the agents were looking for. jim comey was still the director of the fbi. mueller had not yet been named special counsel. the fbi investigation into russian meddling in the just-completed presidential election was in its infancy.
