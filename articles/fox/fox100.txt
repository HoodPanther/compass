the internet reacting to senator john mccain asking for more twitter followers.

fox's krystin goodwin explains:

on monday arizona senator john mccain took to twitter to ask followers for help posting:

we're only 74 twitter followers away from 3m - spread the word & help us reach this big milestone! -- john mccain (@senjohnmccain) december 4, 2017

it backfired. critics and democrats used the republican senator's plea to take aim at him for supporting the gop tax bill. they began using the hashtag '#unfollowmccain, claiming the bill mainly benefits large corporations and the wealthy.

one tweeting: "since you chose to care about only yourself and wealthy friends i chose to unfollow."

following his post, senator mccain lost close to 20,000 twitter followers.
