it turns out matt lauer has brief appearances in two critically acclaimed films this year.

lauer, who was fired from the "today" show on nov. 29 for "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace," actually appears in both "lady bird" and "i, tonya." in "lady bird" -- a coming-of-age drama set in the early 2000s starring saoirse ronan -- ronan's character christine watches lauer and his former co-host, katie couric, on television as he reports on 9/11.

in "i, tonya" -- which stars margot robbie as disgraced figure skater tonya harding -- lauer is also shown reporting the news in real life, this time about the infamous 1994 attack on harding's rival, nancy kerrigan.

so far, it appears lauer's appearances in both films won't be cut following his sexual misconduct scandal. et has reached out for comment.

last month, kevin spacey was cut from the j. paul getty biopic "all the money in the world" and replaced by christopher plummer, in the wake of the multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against spacey. the bold move necessitated plummer reshooting all of spacey's scenes.

et recently spoke to plummer, who commented on the recasting.

"the situation is very sad, because hes such a talented guy," plummer said of spacey. "the whole circumstance is sad. but ive got to forget that and go and do it, because its a very well-written script and [director] ridley [scott] has been very good."
