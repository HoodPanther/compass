and a reminder for alabama voters and social conservatives that character is crucial.

al franken has promised under pressure to step down from the u.s. senate in the coming weeks. he was not accused of such grave crimes as rape or preying on underage children. he was accused instead of grabbing, fondling, lunging at and humiliating seven women. if true, and i think we see a pattern here, this would make him a pig, a bully and a hypocrite. his departure, while personally sad, is no loss to american democracy.

it was not mad puritanism that chased him from office; it was his colleagues finally, belatedly announcing and establishing standards of behavior. this is not an unreasonable or unhelpful thing to do.

journalists and political figures of my generation have been wryly remembering what we had to put up with in the old dayshow a woman couldnt get on an elevator with sen. strom thurmond without being pinched or patted. all true. but even thurmond would not have survived a photo of him leering over a sleeping woman and posingdeliberately, perhaps sadistically, so the moment could be memorializedas he grabbed or simulated grabbing her breasts, which is what mr. franken did. the franken case represents not a collapse of tolerance for flawed human behavior but a rise of judgment about what is acceptable.

people speak of mixed motives and say its all brute politics. the democrats are positioning themselves for the high ground should republican roy moore be elected. theyre aligning themselves with the passions of their base, while clearing the way for a probe into sexual-harassment accusations against the president. new yorks sen. kirsten gillibrand, who led the charge that forced mr. frankens departure, hopes to run for president in 2020 as a champion of women, so the move was happily on-brand. i dont doubt all of this is true. little in politics comes from wholly clean hands.
