with the help of two neighbors, nash coached white through the delivery of marlee jane while waiting for an ambulance crew to arrive. cardena williamson and bri anderson provided blankets and towels to white and the baby.

i dont know what i would have done, nash told fox 5 atlanta. i would have been waiting for the ambulance to come with a whole baby in my hand.
