the decision by the nfl compensation committee on wednesday to give commissioner roger goodell a five-year contract extension that could top out at nearly $40 million a year is pure craziness. nfl owners are watching their brand implode and tv ratings for games plummet under a reckless commissioner  and they fail to see that goodell is running the wrong game plan.

giving goodell a huge compensation package like this  90 percent of it tied to incentives  is like giving hillary clinton an award for outstanding email practices and honesty.

goodells contract extension is a slap in the face to everyone who cares about showing respect for our national anthem, the american flag, americans serving in the military and veterans. continuing to alienate conservatives will prove to be the single worst business decision in the history of the nfl.

it has never been the american way to treat customers like the enemy or alienate a wide group of your brands audience. yet goodell and his protesting players have managed to do this.

goodell was in charge while the nfl burned in flames as american patriots refused to watch games where players protested our sacred symbols. he should be held accountable to his failure to stop this defeat of reason.
