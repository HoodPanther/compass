an art display at john jay college of criminal justice has generated a great deal of attention, not for the paintings themselves, but rather the men who painted them.

ode to the sea, a gallery currently being hosted on john jays new york city campus, houses paintings completed by current and former detainees of guantanamo bay prison.

wanting to know what students on campus thought of their school using resources to promote the work of suspected terrorists, campus reform headed to john jay to find out.
