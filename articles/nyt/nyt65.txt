the places to eat that i like best are imperfect. they might have unsteady tables and bony chairs, set too close together, and doors that dont shut properly, letting in every hiss of wind. they might keep erratic hours, close early without warning and never answer the phone. a dish might touch heaven on one visit and fall to earth the next.

what they give me is something more: entry not only to a cuisine, but also to a part of the city i wouldnt otherwise have a chance to know. i wish there were room here to include all the places that surprised me this year: a bhutanese snooker hall. a cuban ventanita (coffee window). a brooklyn pizzeria whose true specialty is egyptian feteer (a many-layered crepe), and a bronx pizzeria whose true specialty is albanian burek (phyllo pie). an ethiopian restaurant that doubles as a temple to street art. a korean-uzbek restaurant serving fernbrake under crystal lights. maybe the only burmese restaurant in town.



everywhere i went, i was welcomed, and made to feel that this was my part of the city, too.

below, in descending order, are the places that taught me the most in 2017.
