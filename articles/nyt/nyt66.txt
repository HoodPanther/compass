in collaboration with wirecutter, a new york times company that reviews and recommends products, here are four other cheap(ish) items to help you have a hygge winter.

slippers

this winter, im on a quest to see how many faux-fur items i can wear at once, partly inspired by this essay on why you should buy a silly winter coat.

when youre settling in for a hygge evening, everything youre wearing should be comfortable. theres even a term for your pants that are oh-so-comfortable but shouldnt be seen in public: hyggebukser. slippers are the exclamation point on your hyggebukser.

the best slippers are fuzzy and warm without making your feet sweaty and are easy to slip on and off without using your hands, which are, of course, busy being warmed by your mug of mulled wine.

wirecutters pick, l.l. beans wicked good moccasins, checks off all those boxes.

dutch oven

comfort food is a hygge must. unfortunately, im no cook  my halfhearted attempts at preparing dinner all inevitably end up affectionately being referred to as gruel by my husband, who is a much better cook.

its a resolution of mine to fix that in 2018, so someday ill put my dutch oven to better use by cooking hearty stews, serving up decadent mac and cheese, and maybe even attempting to replicate my mother-in-laws knoephla soup recipe. (its a north dakota thing.)

miniature lights

lighting is an integral part of hygge. according to the little book of hygge, 85 percent of danes mention candles when asked what they most associate with hygge.

im here to make the case for indoor miniature lights, too. tiny, warm white lights add a glow that magnifies that hygge vibe. line your mantle or bookshelves, and dont store them away until at least february (please unplug when unattended, friends). its not lazy. its hygge!

wirecutters pick is ges energy smart colorite led miniature lights.

dog bed

for me, peak hygge is curling up on my couch with my hyggebukser, slippers and mulled wine as my dog, zuki, rests in my lap or on my leg. she is kind of a hygge expert.

but dogs need their own hygge spot, too. if you have a four-legged friend keeping you company, think about getting the majestic pet products suede bagel dog bed, wirecutters favorite dog bed for most pooches.
