alison and adam sadel met in 2011 at the equinox health club in grand central terminal, where she worked and he was a member. they later moved in together, living with two roommates in a rental building in williamsburg, brooklyn.

nearly four years ago, equinox transferred ms. sadel, then alison hornstein, to toronto, as the company was expanding in canada. she rented a one-bedroom in a new condominium tower downtown, with a den, balcony, washer-dryer and two bathrooms. mr. sadel soon followed, finding a job in property management there.

last winter, however, they decided it was time to return to new york. mr. sadel, now 32, took a job in manhattan as a broker for park river properties, which specializes in condo conversions. the couple knew that ms. sadel, an account executive at equinox, would be able to transfer back to new york, though it was unclear exactly where she would be based. so mr. sadel lived with his parents in northern new jersey while he looked for a one-bedroom and she wrapped up things in canada.

it had been my job in toronto to pick an apartment, said ms. sadel, 29. adam moved in sight unseen. now it was my turn to trust him. besides, she had other things to think about: at the time, they were engaged and she was busy planning their wedding at the brooklyn botanic garden.

the sadels wanted to live in a relatively new building close to their jobs in manhattan, and hoped to spend about $3,500 a month for a one-bedroom. mr. sadels priority was a large closet; ms. sadels was an open kitchen. two bathrooms, they thought, would be nice, too.

once you have two bathrooms, its hard to go back to one, mr. sadel said, though he assumed it was inevitable. we were looking for something similar to what we had in toronto without sacrificing too much.

mr. sadel began looking in brooklyn heights, where they had friends. but apartments seemed small for the price, and many of the buildings were old. he knew they would find more space in williamsburg, as well as plenty of buildings built in the last decade or so, as the neighborhood had changed substantially in the few years they had been gone.
