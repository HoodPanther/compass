wednesday puzzle  i like to believe that if a constructor goes to the trouble of making a puzzle that incorporates a particular shtick, there is a good reason for it. perhaps a letter of the alphabet  the letter m, say  is special to this constructor, and he loves it so much he festoons not only his grid with it, but the clues as well (you did notice the clues, right?)

i would further like to believe that the reason the letter m is so special to this constructor is because his name begins with it. or is in there somewhere. and yet here we have clive probert, who, as far as his byline in concerned, is completely m-less. so much for that theory.

todays theme

its not hard to see that something is up, if you scan the clue list looking for gimmes before solving. every clue in mr. proberts puzzle begins with the letter m.

what is interesting in this puzzle is that every single one of the entries also has the letter m in it.

setting constraints like these can lead to a lot of crossword glue, and they keep the constructor from adding really sparkling fill, because at that point, the constructor is just hoping that the grid fills acceptably. mr. probert gets the job done in that regard, and i liked that i learned the name of the muse of memory, mneme. from a cluing standpoint, the visual of the vertical line of ms is nice, but the constraint makes some of the clues sound stilted. theres definitely a place for puzzles like this once in a while.

tricky clues

the funny thing about todays puzzle is that the all clues begin with an m and all entries contain an m constraints both helped and hindered my solve. if i didnt immediately know the answer to the clue, knowing that the answer needed to contain an m helped me narrow things down quite a bit. on the other hand, because the clues were written to begin with an m, they didnt immediately prompt an answer in my brain.
