he broke through in 1979, signing the running backs eric dickerson and craig james to form the schools so-called pony express backfield. dickerson, who would have a hall of fame pro career, had committed to attend texas a&m (and denied receiving a gold trans am as an inducement to go to there) but changed his mind.

he bought the dream that i sold, meyer said in the espn documentary pony excess (2010).

s.m.u. finished with an 8-4 record in 1980. but after the season, the n.c.a.a. cited 29 recruiting violations by the football program, including four by meyer. he was accused of letting potential recruits believe that they could sell complimentary season tickets, but the university said it later cleared him of the allegation. the mustangs were placed on probation for two years and were barred from playing in bowl games or televising their games in 1981.

professionally, its the low point of my 18-year career, meyer told the associated press. ive had disappointing saturdays and overcome them. and, he said, ill overcome this.

he did  and so did s.m.u. with its 10-1 record, the mustangs won the conference championship. dickerson rushed for 1,428 yards. james ran for 1,147. but when the season ended, meyer left for the then-lowly patriots, fulfilling his dream to coach in the national football league.

late in a snowy game between the patriots and the miami dolphins in 1982 at schaefer stadium in foxborough, mass., meyer called a timeout and summoned the snowplow operator to clear a path behind the line of scrimmage for the patriots john smith to kick a field goal. the miami coach, don shula, declared the move unsportsmanlike  and said he wanted to throttle meyer  but the move, though unusual, was legal. smiths 33-yard field goal was good, and the patriots won, 3-0.

meyer said afterward that the plowing  wasnt an attempt to cheat anybody.

although some players chafed at his strict rules, meyer turned the patriots around quickly. in the season before he took over, they were 2-14. but in the strike-shortened 1982 season, they were 5-4 and made the playoffs. (they lost to miami.)

winning cures cancer, he told the miami news after his first season in new england. what the hell, thats basically the bottom line.

but in 1984, halfway through the season  after meyer fired rod rust, the teams popular defensive coordinator, without consulting his bosses  meyer himself was fired and replaced by raymond berry, the hall of fame wide receiver.

meyer won immediately at his next stop, indianapolis. he succeeded rod dowhower in 1986 when the colts were 0-13 and led them as they won the final three games of the season. after guiding them to a 9-6 record in 1987 and to the playoffs (where they lost, to cleveland), he was named the american football conference coach of the year. but he was dismissed in midseason in 1991, when the colts were 0-5.

meyers departure from s.m.u. and move to the n.f.l. saved him from being swept up in subsequent scandals at the university. finding that the mustangs program under meyers successor, bobby collins, had made improper payments to players, the n.c.a.a. imposed its so-called death penalty, barring s.m.u. from playing football in 1987 and placing it on probation through 1990.

meyer coached twice more after leaving the colts: with the las vegas posse, a canadian football league franchise, in 1994, and then in 2001 with the chicago enforcers of the xfl, a league formed by nbc and the world wrestling federation (now world wrestling entertainment).

at the time, he said he hoped that the xfl, which would last only one season, would be a steppingstone for him to the n.f.l.

it rekindles the fire, so to speak, he told the scripps-howard news service. it was never my idea to leave the sideline. it was the idea of a few people called the owners.
