pensacola, fla.  president trumps crowd will be here in florida friday night, but his audience will be in alabama.

just four days before a crucial special election for a united states senate seat in alabama, mr. trump is expected to again offer his unequivocal backing for the republican nominee, roy s. moore, a candidate dogged by accusations from women, including one who was 14 at the time, that he had assaulted them or had inappropriate contact with them decades ago.

the president will be less than 30 miles from the border to alabama, which shares both media markets and many conservative cultural affinities with its neighbor. the presidents supporters began lining up hours before his arrival at the pensacola center.

mr. moore has denied the accusations, and the president has cited those denials as a justification for his endorsement, saying that mr. moore would be better than having a liberal in the senate, a reference to mr. moores democratic opponent, doug jones.

by endorsing mr. moore on monday, staking his credibility on his denials, mr. trump is taking a position decidedly at odds with many in his party in the growing debate over sexual harassment in the worlds of politics, media and entertainment, choosing to support a man who was accused rather than the women who say he abused them.

mr. trump has already made a campaign appearance in the alabama senate race but it was not for mr. moore.
