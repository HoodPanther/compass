the first episode of at home with amy sedaris makes clear that this is not going to be business  or rather, home economics  as usual.

fish, ms. sedaris declares as the camera pans over a line of slimy, whole sea-beasts. a strange, coldblooded and limbless creature that thrives in the stuff we drown in. a thing of nightmares. but when battered and pan-fried, scrumptious!

at home with amy sedaris, the first season of which is airing tuesdays on trutv and ends dec. 19, is itself a disturbing and delicious beast, a sendup of tv home shows that draws on ms. sedariss sunshiny comic versatility to explore the dark oddities in the back of the spice cabinet.

set on a pastel-colored play stage, at home is like barefoot contessa through the looking glass. ms. sedaris, playing a version of herself, throws open her house to a rotating cast of eccentrics and frenemies, inviting us in to watch the ensuing d.i.y. lunacy.

ms. sedaris created at home with paul dinello, her partner on the cult high school satire strangers with candy. it shares a homespun-hallucinatory sensibility with that show, as well as adult swim series like the heart, she holler (whose creators are also executive producers here).

but ms. sedaris is also a sincere lover of crafting whos written two only partly tongue-in-cheek books on hospitality and entertaining. this makes at home feel playful and affectionate, rather than merely snarky. indeed, many of the household tips on at home actually work. (no corkscrew? open a wine bottle by standing it in a shoe and whacking the heel against a wall. youre welcome.)

the heart of the shows comedy is recognizing that decorating, crafting and presentation are about appearances. there can be a subtext of pathos to a home show, like there is to a trying-too-hard instagram feed: youre taking broken and disappointing things and pasting googly eyes and glitter onto them until it all looks like happiness.
