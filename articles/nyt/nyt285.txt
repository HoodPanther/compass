friday puzzle  by the time you read this, i will be toasting the passengers joining us aboard the queen mary 2 as part of the times journeys crossword cruise to england, and im very excited. its my first cruise, and i cant wait to solve my way across the atlantic with a group of fellow puzzleheads. also, buffets. i am unnaturally excited about the buffets.

you will be in excellent hands with the surprisingly dangerous caitlin lovinger until i come back after christmas. i wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season, and i will try not to write with a british accent when i come back.

paolo pasco returns with a fabulously twisty friday crossword that is a lovely balance of both modern and standard entries, so if you are not familiar with the 1990s nickelodeon star kel mitchell or even queens radio gaga, there is enough in mr. pascos grid to at least get you that all-important foothold. and there are a whopping 12 sparkling debuts to enjoy, including jean shorts, escape room, radio gaga, bites at, puzzle box (how about that cluster of zs just southeast of the center of the puzzle?), knew it, i meant to say, ninja stars (which i first tried to enter as shurikens), a.p. credit, total income, the elements and subtweet.
