variety puzzle  another quick one today, as i have been called to test out the buffets on the coming times journeys crossword cruise. when food and duty call, i am there.

daniel raymon returns with another cryptic crossword, and i have to say i really enjoy his cryptic puzzles. maybe ive just gotten better at them since i solved brian greers harry potter cryptic crossword, but mr. raymons clues are definitely on my wavelength.

and i really like that mr. raymons entries are lively; some cryptics have fairly ordinary fill and rely on the clues for the entertainment.

the clue that made me laugh the most was 8ds site where you can find matches and order ham on rye, because ordering food would have been an excellent feature back when i was using online dating sites. the answer happens to be e-harmony, with the definition being site where you can find online matches and order asks you to anagram ham on rye to e-harmony.
