rome  it has been a question of theological debate and liturgical interpretation for years, and now pope francis has joined the discussion: does the lords prayer, christendoms resonant petition to the almighty, need an update?

in a new television interview, pope francis said the common rendering of one line in the prayer  lead us not into temptation  was not a good translation from ancient texts. do not let us fall into temptation, he suggested, might be better because god does not lead people into temptation; satan does.

a father doesnt do that, the pope said. he helps you get up right away. what induces into temptation is satan.

in essence, the pope said, the prayer, from the book of matthew, is asking god, when satan leads us into temptation, you please, give me a hand.

french catholics adopted such a linguistic change this week, and the pope suggested that italian catholics might want to follow suit.

while francis remarks were not a decree to change the prayer, he has once again set off a debate on how far a pope can or should go in shaking up longstanding tradition, and even doctrine.
