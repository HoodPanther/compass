sunday puzzle  good crosswords and street scams like the shell game have a lot in common, believe it or not. thats not an attempt to deprecate our beloved pastime. its an acknowledgment that they both capitalize on misdirection and our love of having our brains twisted.

todays puzzle by david steinberg combines the best of both by turning our sunday puzzle into a scam, which is purely for our entertainment, officer.

todays theme

the toughest part of solving todays puzzle will be figuring out the theme, or at least part of the theme. there is a lot going on in this puzzle and im going to completely spill the beans, so to speak. if you dont want to see the entire theme, please avert your eyes.

mr. steinbergs grid pulls the wool over our eyes by setting up a shell game with three overturned nut shells depicted by shaded squares. near the top of the grid, we have (from left to right) a walnut, a cashew and an almond shell, with a pea rebus in a circled square outside of the shells. yes, it is indeed sneaky to have a single rebus in a puzzle, but thats not the entire scam. theres more.

mr. steinberg himself says in two of the clues (65a and 86a) that the entries would be the clues if his game wasnt a scam. what could he mean by that?
