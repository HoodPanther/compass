the reader center is a newsroom initiative that is helping the times build deeper ties with our audience.

with president trumps announcement yesterday that the united states now formally recognizes jerusalem as the capital of israel and will move its embassy there, many readers have taken to our comments section to express either their consternation or approval.

however, few readers have commented about their personal experiences with the city.

perhaps you have lived there, have ancestral roots there or have visited. we want to hear what the city means to you. we may publish a selection of the responses.
