wednesday puzzle  my first reaction upon filling in the first theme entry (18a) in erik agards puzzle was, hey! its the supremes! i know, the real answer did not refer to the award-winning singing group, but by the time i finished and got the revealer at 74a, i realized that it actually did.

that is some nice thematic whiplash for a wednesday, mr. agard. nicely done.

todays theme

mr. agards theme comes just in time for the cold weather weve been experiencing in the northeast. i have never heard a motown song that hasnt made me want to get up and dance, and that keeps the blood moving.

the first word in each of the theme entries is a singular member of a motown group: the supremes, the contours, the miracles and the temptations.

mr. agards puzzles typically have entries in them that are tough for some solvers to get, but this one felt very accessible. he has also embiggened his grid and increased the maximum word count, but i dont mind that. there are plenty of fun entries  including not one but two types of japanese noodles, ramen and udon  and the puzzle doesnt feel crowded to me at all.
