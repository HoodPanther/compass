the eighth edition of the lagosphoto festival opened last week and runs through dec. 15th. azu nwagbogu, the festivals founder and director, spoke with james estrin about photography in africa. their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

q.

what is your goal with the lagos photo festival?

a.

i feel like photography has the power to make us understand the world better and to create empathy. so the goal is to have more visual storytellers telling more new stories to enable us to imagine a newer, better, richer, more prosperous, more safe, more empowered africa.

in the past, the stories were told to create pity, and pity is an emotion that is not sustainable, that is easily dismissed, that does not allow us to understand or appreciate how to engage in that community. you just look away. and we are not trying to make people look away, we are trying to make people understand and invite them to share and to be part of that story.

q.

how did you put together this years festival?

a.

the theme of the festival is regimes of truth. we are exploring a further understanding of the post-truth society that we live in. now we are either inundated with so much information, or we have constructed another reality of what the truth is.

so its really looking at the way photography, the media and artists explore these notions of what is true and what is real. because photography was founded on the science of observation, and it has always flattered itself to be a representative or an arbiter of truth.

in contemporary society, we now know that an image can be very deceptive and it can be propaganda. but at the same time we understand that visual language is becoming more decipherable by many more people, and thats one of the reasons why i feel africa is getting a lot of attention, mainly because of photography.

photography created a pejorative view of the continent. photography is also able to emancipate the impression that we have of africa.

we have some really interesting work. samuel fossos black pope (slide 7) explores the way religion and its symbols and objects that are used to create the narrative of a papal figure are so removed from the african context and culture that it almost promotes this idea of whiteness and white supremacy. in the history of the papacy, there has never been a black pope, while today the greatest number of roman catholics is actually in africa.

q.

in the 19th century, photography was thought to be scientifically accurate. photojournalism still holds the conceit that one can be accurate in a sense. in a post-truth society, what does truth mean in relation to photography?

a.

i think through photography, especially photojournalism, we can sometimes establish the facts. when you have the facts, you can build on them and create the architecture that becomes the truth of the story.

photojournalism is still very important in establishing the facts. how many people died, how many people traveled, who were the people in the room at that time. photography can still do this. but to tell the story, you need to build a truth. but the truth is complex and the truth is something that we all search for. so i think that is always the balance between photography and visual culture.

q.

how do you see the history of photography in africa, and what is the role of photography in africa today?

a.

it was photography that was used to create a dominant view for the colonizer over the africans. and that is all about the colonizer with his hand over objects, or over his subjects. and its always about power, domination, control. so thats really been the history of photography on the continent. its always been completely based on propaganda.

when we reflect on this in contemporary times, we want to reverse that.

we feel that sometimes we learn more through fiction than through what is considered to be factual. for example, the best information about russia in the 19th century, when there was a lot of censorship, comes through fiction. so for us, its always finding that dance between the fictional and the factual. and also reclaiming african identity, which is really important to us.

we feel like we cant use one approach. we have to adopt both. a lot of the fictive images seem to get more attention, but we have always had a strong documentary effort in the festivals.

q.

other than by exhibiting the stories, how do you build a culture and community of photographers to tell them? or is that too elitist?

a.

no, i think thats a mission of the festival. its always about building a community that has ownership, passion, and a feeling of adventure and camaraderie. we want to shape the way the stories that relate to africa are told, and i think thats really the most important thing that we can achieve. and thats by shaping and expanding the community of visual storytellers.

one of the legacies of colonial intervention is a fragmentation of community. and where you have fragmentation of community it becomes harder to come together to grow.

we have conventional african storytellers trying to tell stories the way they think the west is interested in seeing the stories. there was not a community to support younger, contemporary visual storytellers on the continent who were trying to find their own voice, trying to find their own language, their own way, their own approach, their own unique, more knowledgeable perspective in telling stories that relate to africa.

but when you have the community, there is a support for more nuanced, more honest, more true, more representative stories of contemporary africa.

q.

i see lot of work from africa that is more in the art space and employs broader storytelling strategies. is there a place in the western media for african photographers? or do they have to adjust or transform to fit that?

a.

i dont think they need to transform. i keep hearing people say africa seems to be in the news, to be hot, to be trending. i think its mainly because lots more people are able to tell their own stories and publish their own stories, by themselves, on social media. so that authorship, independent of the mainstream, has generated this interest in the unique voices and stories in africa.

i dont think theres a real need to adapt or to change to a more understandable or decipherable visual language that the west is interested in. its more about developing an authentic voice and making sure that its consistent and coherent.

q.

how?

a.

my message to practitioners on the continent is we shouldnt follow western journalism or art institutions, which are dominated by white males. rather, we should innovate and find ways to be more representative, to include other voices. media houses on the continent have to make sure they have as many women as men, and you have to make sure that you have women as editors. if you have enough diversity from the beginning, it makes it easier to make sure that youre telling stories that are diverse, that are inclusive, that are more all embracing.

its really an exciting time on the continent  a lot is happening and a lot can still happen.

q.

how about social class?

a.

class is a massive problem in africa, but the wonderful thing is that because of the communal nature of society, youre never too far removed from those above and below you.

class is always an issue in terms of breaking the mold and inviting more people to engage in the wider public discourse. thats why contemporary art is so important. you come into an artists vision in public spaces where you have what i call interdependence  where people can agree or disagree, share ideas, in a very peaceful and a very safe zone with others of all classes. so there is really no need for conflict.

q.

how are you bringing work to the public?

a.

we curate exhibitions in public spaces, like parks, where people can leave comments in any language about what they feel about the work. the most interesting comments we get are from people who might not feel comfortable in museums or galleries but feel very comfortable in parks.

q.

how did you get involved in photography?

a.

fifteen years ago when i was a writer and a scientist i realized that photography was the most powerful tool for visual storytelling, engagement and emancipation. and once i got into it i never looked back.

q.

were you ever a photographer?

a.

not at all. i was more of a writer and curator. those were my interests, my passion, so curating and writing is what i did.

q.

the festival doesnt only feature photographers who were born in africa.

a.

absolutely not. i think its really stupid that people sometimes question that. a lot of the work that exists on the continent has been made by photographers from elsewhere.

sometimes the work is really, really good and meaningful and nuanced and well done, so why shouldnt we show that? its empowering, and also its important that the local photographers see themselves as equals with anyone else. so thats really the strength of the festival, is the fact that we do not isolate.

when it comes to empowering the continent, we do ourselves a disservice by saying, you are not black enough or you are not african enough. because africans go to europe and improve the culture  evolve the culture, the language, the music, the art, the sport and everything else.

and when the reverse happens, we get scared or anxious about it. as long as we are shaping the narrative and we are not being overrun by the other voices, its important to invite many voices because its really about your sensibility, not the color of your skin.

but its always about work that relates to the continent. i would say that your color of skin is not important.

q.

you talk about africa, but what does morocco have in common with ethiopia, or ghana? what do you mean when you say africa?

a.

africa is the most diverse continent on the planet. so our job really is to tell the stories of these various disparate communities. presenting these wonderful diverse stories makes us richer.

i dont think that i have one africa. im a pan-africanist. i believe the pan-africanist approach is so much more interesting, more fun and more empowering, but at the same time we embrace the diversity across the continent because that makes us richer.

q.

then what is the commonality? that they were all colonies of europe?

a.

absolutely. the colonial history and the legacy have created a post-colonial continent with post-colonial trauma. we have the symptoms of trauma across the continent as a common theme. so i really dont want to emphasize too much the negative, but people talk about colonization or colonialism as a stain, but its better understood as being actually woven into the very fabric of the continent.

q.

can that be transformed into something useful or positive?

a.

it must be, because decolonization starts by owning up to the fact that its already intricately woven into our dna. and once you accept that position, then it empowers you to evolve from that.

when we think about art on the continent, the instinct is to look back. and that nostalgia for the past has kept the continent trapped in this loop.

we look back to before the colonialists intervention, to the masks, the sculptures, the objects. but we cannot go back to the masks. we love them, we think theyre beautiful and along with the pyramids they are a testament to the ingenuity of the people on the continent. but going back to that is almost like denying the fact that we have evolved and we are learning and we are able to take from the colonialists and shape a new language, shape a new culture. because culture really is progressive if you want to find your peace, your balance, to feed your mind, to feed your soul in this world.

we want a future. you see the term afrofuturism everywhere. we curated a show for the festival four years ago about afrofuturism  africans imagining a better future for themselves using technologies, many of which were not created on the continent.

so when you talk about colonization, its about saying, were going to shape our future now. and really shape and control every narrative.

you know the story of the hunt is told by the hunter. the lion will always be the victim. if the lion would be able to tell its own story, the story would be different.
