the evolution of beauty: how darwins forgotten theory of mate choice shapes the animal world  and us

by richard o. prum

if a science book can be subversive and feminist and change the way we look at our own bodies  but also be mostly about birds  this is it. prum, an ornithologist, mounts a defense of darwins second, largely overlooked theory of sexual selection. darwin believed that, in addition to evolving to adapt to the environment, some other force must be at work shaping the species: the aesthetic mating choices made largely by the females. prum wants subjectivity and the desire for beauty to be part of our understanding of how evolution works. its a passionate plea that begins with birds and ends with humans and will help you finally understand, among other things, how in the world we have an animal like the peacock.
