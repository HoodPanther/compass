london  the crown, the netflix drama about the life of queen elizabeth ii, returns for its second season on dec. 8. it picks up roughly where last season left off, the latest installment in a series that aims to track englands longest reigning monarch up to the present day. (claire foy, who currently stars as elizabeth, will be replaced by the older olivia colman next season.)

the first season spanned the period from just before the death of elizabeths father, king george vi, through the early years of her own reign, portraying the challenges she faced both as queen and as a mother, wife and sister. while the dialogue is fictional, the major events depicted were based on historical fact.
