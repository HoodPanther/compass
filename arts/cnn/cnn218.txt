trail, ore. (sbg) - a 1979 porsche 924 reported stolen from a movie theater parking lot in medford decades ago has been located at the base of a steep cliff in the woods southwest of crater lake, the jackson county sheriff's office said.

"heavy forest debris indicated the vehicle had been there for a significant period of time. the registration tags expired in 1991," the sheriff's office said in a report. "further investigation found the porsche was reported stolen on january 20, 1991, from the parking lot of the southside cinema in medford."

a man happened upon the wreckage tuesday afternoon while following his dog off abbott prairie road, north of elk creek road.

"the position of the vehicle at the base of a cliff made it nearly impossible to see from the road above," the sheriff's office reported.

detectives checked the wreckage the next day. bones found on the ground nearby belonged to a deer. no human remains were found.

now the sheriff's office is working to determine how to remove the porsche.

"the vehicle's location on steep, rugged terrain presents logistical and environmental concerns for removal," the sheriff's office reported. "sheriff's office officials are working to determine the best course of action."
