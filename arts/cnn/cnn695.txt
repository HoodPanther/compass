story highlights major brewers are voluntarily adding labels with nutrition facts

this will effect more than 81% of the total volume of beer sold in the united states

(cnn) the most popular alcoholic beverage in america is about to get all health-conscious: most beer brewers are voluntarily including freshness dating, calories, nutritional details and an ingredients list on their labels. the goal for brewers and importers is to fasten new labels on all their cans and bottles by the end of 2020, said the beer institute. however, the new labels should begin appearing immediately.

anheuser-busch, millercoors, heinekenusa, constellation brands beer division, north american breweries and the craft brew alliance --- institute members, one and all --- have agreed to make the change. combined, these companies produce more than 81% of the total volume of beer sold in the united states, the institute said in a statement.

"some craft beers have as many calories as a hamburger or an ice cream cone," said betsy thurston , an atlanta-area registered dietician who specializes in eating and weight concerns. "why shouldn't we be entitled to know what we are consuming?"

beer companies will add a serving facts statement to their labels.

according to jim mcgreevy, president and ceo of the beer institute, the initiative provides consumers with "meaningful information" that will "empower" their decision-making. in some cases, brewers may also provide a reference to a website or a qr code with added nutritional information. some of the participating companies say they've already taken steps toward greater transparency.

"we are fully supportive of this initiative and already provide significant information about our beers at www.tapintoyourbeer.com," anheuser-busch said.
