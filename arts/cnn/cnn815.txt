story highlights the actor struggled to articulate why he quit

he said he wasn't expecting the sadness of his latest role

(cnn) daniel day-lewis is known for immersing himself in his roles, but this time around it may have ended his acting career.

the esteemed actor recently talked to w magazine about his role as couturier reynolds woodcock in the forthcoming film "phantom thread," directed by paul thomas anderson.

day-lewis got so into character that he learned to sew -- apprenticing for months under the head of the costume department at the new york city ballet -- and even recreated a balenciaga sheath dress using his wife, filmmaker rebecca miller, as his model.

but the 60 year-old actor said diving into the life of woodcock and all the drama it entailed also sunk him into a depression.

"before making the film, i didn't know i was going to stop acting," he said. "i do know that paul and i laughed a lot before we made the movie. and then we stopped laughing because we were both overwhelmed by a sense of sadness."
