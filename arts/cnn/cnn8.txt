(cnn) french president emmanuel macron called the sale of migrants at slave auctions in libya "a crime against humanity" and vowed to press for sanctions.

france has requested an "urgent" meeting of the un security council to discuss this treatment of migrants in libya, foreign minister jean-yves le drian said. france will advocate for international sanctions against libya if its justice system fails to act, he said.
