(cnn)  hidden in the foothills of the indian himalayas, the largely agricultural village of bir is better known to visitors by its nickname -- the "paragliding capital of india ."

located in the state of himachal pradesh in northern india, this small village has witnessed a boom in popularity among international paragliders after it hosted the paragliding world cup in 2015.

"paragliding has made this village famous. otherwise, very few people knew about it," says arvind paul, a paragliding instructor.

"the local community has benefited a lot from it. 100% of the locals are farmers, but this is a good side-business for us, because during the rainy season there is no work here."

there are around 140 local paragliders in the village now. among them is 16-year-old aditi tharkur.

"i'm india's youngest female paraglider," she says.

"i used to see paragliders from my house. they looked so small, i really liked them. then i told my father that i want to learn. i wanted to fly with all my heart."
