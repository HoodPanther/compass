"after a thorough investigation, warner bros. television group has terminated andrew kreisberg's employment, effective immediately," the company said in a statement to cnn. "we remain committed to providing a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions."

the company began its investigation into accusations against kreisberg, who co-created several of the cw's hit comic book shows ("the flash," "supergirl," "arrow" and "dc's legends of tomorrow") earlier this month.

warner bros. tv said greg berlanti, whose company berlanti productions oversees the series, is expected to assume "additional responsibilities" on both "the flash" and "supergirl" in light of kreisberg's firing.

"nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of all our colleagues  coworkers, crew and staff alike."
