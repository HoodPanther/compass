minneapolis (wcco)  one twin cities man spends 365 nights a year on the streets.

he delivers sandwiches, coats and bus tokens every day. you may have heard of allan law  also known as the sandwich man.

more than two million people have watched a viral video following him around one winter night. the retired teacher says he believes god put him on the earth to help the homeless.

as susan-elizabeth littlefield shows us, now  someone else is trying to help him.

my neighbors see me rolling the grocery cart up and down, moving 700 sandwiches at a time, going out about 8 oclock, law said.

this is ground zero for allan laws mission. his apartment has 20 freezers. its ground zero for his charity, love one another.

he also uses four storage units. each packed to the brim with snacks, blankets and gifts for the kids.

ive got in here about 40 stuffed animals like this, law said.

hes just such a hero that would be i guess how i would explain him, teri bennett of excelsior said.

bennett heard about the sandwiches a few years back, and started volunteering. she realized allan is in need, too.

he said, i need a warehouse. i said ok, i dont have one of those, bennett said.

but she does have a computer, and a son who helped her start a gofundme.

i let the budget at $15,000, which clearly that wouldnt cover everything. i hope its a hundred times that, law said.

what would it be like to have your own warehouse? it would be beautiful as far as convenience and a place i could meet with a group of people, law said.

allans charity is turning 50. hes never asked anyone to write a check, but sometimes when you pay it forward, it comes back.

lets just blow the socks off it. i just think it should be the hugest anniversary present ever, bennett said.

if the gofundme raises enough money, allan also dreams of getting a larger van one day so he can help many more people.
