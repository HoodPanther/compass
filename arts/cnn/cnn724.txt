when temperatures drop outside, it's extra cozy to gather in the living room with friends and family to watch tv. what's even better is when the holidays start to dictate what's airing. suddenly, summer romantic comedies have been replaced by famous holiday tv specials and movies. "christmas story," anyone?

whatever it is you're into  the latest series or hosting viewing parties (not long until the new year's eve ball drop and the super bowl!) it may be time to invest in a brand-new shiny tv. with black friday rolling around soon, we're thinking now is the time to buy.

in fact, amazon has already released some of its tv deals  and boy, are they good. keep scrolling to see the major savings you could score on your new big-screen.
