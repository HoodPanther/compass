story highlights liyjon desilva finished high school in houston after being homeless for several years

he received academic accolades and is going to college this autumn

(cnn) liyjon desilva had a secret.

he kept it at night, when he could see the stars in the sky as he went to bed in a parking lot. he kept it during the day, when he attended classes at lee high school in houston.

desilva at first didn't tell school administrators and teachers that he had been homeless for three years -- since he was 15 -- after he bounced around different relatives' homes. his mom died when he was 5 and he grew up in poverty.

but when a school social worker began to break the ice, desilva's life took a turn. the student, who slept on buses and in parks, had been struggling to stay in the school and was unable to come up with residency documents.

"i didn't trust her at first. i thought she was with the school trying to ask why i had missing documents, but she kept chasing me just trying to figure out what was going on and how she could help. once i finally opened up to her, things started to change for the better," said desilva.
