by now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a minnesota dentist visiting zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. it spawned millions of posts on facebook and twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.

cecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (the dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)

the intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? the surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.

this view is bringing together an unlikely collection of suddenly like-minded critics. from the left and the right, there is a growing sense that the outpouring of grief for cecil is unseemly.
