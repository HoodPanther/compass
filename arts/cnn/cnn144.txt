founded as a political party in 2011, britain first is an ultra-nationalist organization that opposes immigration and claims to have "a proven track record of opposing islamic militants and hate preachers."

according to searchlight, a magazine that investigates and reports on far-right and fascist groups, britain first emerged as a splinter group following a collapse in support for the far-right british national party.
