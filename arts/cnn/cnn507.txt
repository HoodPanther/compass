story highlights showings ending as of december 8

fans have complained about the short

(cnn) no, fans did not love "olaf's frozen adventure," but that's not reportedly why the short is being pulled from theaters.

ew reports the disney short film, which has been screening before pixar's acclaimed new animated film "coco," was always meant to have a short run.

but the ending of showings as of december 8 led some to speculate it was because fans have been panning it.
