story highlights children and their bedrooms are shown in the photo series "where children sleep"

the 56 diverse photos portray a world of poverty and privilege

(cnn) a child's bedroom often expresses their identity. from brightly colored walls filled with posters to toys and books scattered around, it is truly their place of comfort. but for some children around the world, their bedroom is no more than a mat outside or a collection of old sheets, tires and trash on a dirt floor.
