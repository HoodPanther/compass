a pair of childhood friends are on their way toward completing a bucket list full of good deeds as one of them faces a devastating cancer prognosis. chris betancourt, 20, was given about one year to live after the leukemia he faced as a child returned in september.

betancourts best friend, dillon hill, was there for him the first time he was diagnosed with chronic mylogenous leukemia, and the pair bonded over their love of video games. tragedy struck for them a second time when betancourts sister, who hill was dating, committed suicide while they were in high school.

in support of his friends recent diagnosis, hill is planning to postpone his studies at uc davis for the upcoming semester while helping betancourt complete his 79-item list.
