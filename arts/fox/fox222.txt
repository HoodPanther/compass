the one thing that i cannot live without when i'm traveling is a small container of tea tree oil, the former suits star revealed in 2014.

it's not the most glamorous thing, but if you get a cut, a mosquito bite, a small breakout, no matter what it is, it's my little cure-all. it's inexpensive, it's small enough to carry on, and i bring it with me all the time," she said.



according to webmd, the former lifestyle blogger is spot on. the outlet agrees that tea tree oil is beneficial for treating blemishes, insect bites, and cuts, as well as serving as an antiseptic to keep germs away. small bottles of the affordable oil begin to retail on amazon at $7.

there's no doubt that there is much jetsetting ahead for markle, as she weds the fifth-in-line to the british throne.
