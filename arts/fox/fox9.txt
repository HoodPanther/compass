a government watchdog who played a central role in the hillary clinton email investigation during the obama administration told fox news that he, his family and his staffers faced an intense backlash at the time from clinton allies  and that the campaign even put out word that it planned to fire him if the democratic presidential nominee won the 2016 election.

there was personal blowback. personal blowback to me, to my family, to my office, former intelligence community inspector general charles mccullough iii said.

the obama appointee discussed his role in the clinton email probe for the first time on television, during an exclusive interview with fox news. mccullough  who came to the inspector general position with more than two decades of experience at the fbi, treasury and intelligence community  shed light on how quickly the probe was politicized and his office was marginalized by democrats.

in january 2016, after mccullough told the republican leadership on the senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that emails beyond the top secret level passed through the former secretary of state's unsecured personal server, the backlash intensified.
