one of country music's biggest stars is comforting a massachusetts school mourning the deaths of three students.

blake shelton recorded a minute-long message that was included in a longer tribute video to the quaboag regional middle/high school students who died in a nov. 6 car crash in west brookfield.

shelton's brother died in a crash nearly three decades ago.

shelton said in the message: "i can understand how you guys feel. it's the worst possible feeling. it's confusion. it's anger. it's just an overall brokenness that's just gonna take a lot of time to heal."

shelton learned of the deaths through his mother, who grew up with the father of a member of quaboag's school committee.

the crash took the lives of 14-year-old jaclyn desrosiers, 15-year-old christian congelos and the driver, 16-year-old lena noonan.
