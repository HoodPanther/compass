fox news - president donald trump on tuesday evening called for a closer look into a former intelligence committee watchdog's claims to fox news that hillary clinton's campaign had a "strategic coordination" with the state department to play down the presence of classified information on her private email server.

"charles mccullough, the respected [former] intel comm inspector general, said public was misled on crooked hillary emails," trump tweeted. "'emails endangered national security.' why arent our deep state authorities looking at this? rigged & corrupt?"

in an exclusive interview with fox news monday, former intelligence community inspector general charles mccullough iii said he suffered "personal blowback" over his pursuit of the email investigation. mccullough claimed the clinton campaign put out word that he would be fired if the democratic nominee won last year's presidential election.

"im well aware there was strategic coordination between the [clinton] campaign, the state department, certain officials in the state department, certain law firms in [washington d.c.] and people on capitol hill and i think that bore itself out in the podesta emails," mccullough told fox news' "tucker carlson tonight."
