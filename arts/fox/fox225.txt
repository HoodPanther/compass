c--- said fillet ofish [sic] is better than chicken nuggets, brown cardigan captioned the post.

oddly enough, this statement sparked a debate over which of the two classic menu items is better.

fillet o fish are about as pleasant as a burning orphanage, one user wrote.

nah fk anyone who thinks little baby chick bone cartilage nuggets are better than fresh organic fillet o fish, another commented.

others made their own suggestions of what started the fight.

thats how i feel when they tell me the soft serve machine isnt working, one user wrote.

probs just pissed off that hash browns are now $1.80 instead of a dollar, suggested another.

this isnt the first time mcdonalds has been the site of a physical altercation. last month, two women at a drive-through in indiana reportedly lunged through the window at the manager who told them they never ordered mcnuggets and would have to go through the line again.
