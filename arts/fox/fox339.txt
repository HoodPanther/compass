editor's note: the following column is adapted from a post which originally appeared on aeideas.org, the blog of the american enterprise institute.

the washington post reports that north korea has carried out its first ballistic missile test in more than two months:

north korea launched a missile early wednesday morning, south koreas joint chiefs of staff said. . . wednesdays missile was launched from pyongan province and fired to the east, south koreas joint chiefs said, according to the yonhap news agency. the military was still working to ascertain what kind of missile it was.

north korea last fired a missile on sept. 15, sending it over the northern japanese island of hokkaido. it was the second launch over japan in less than three weeks and came less than two weeks after north korea exploded what was widely believed to be a hydrogen bomb.

in a speech to the council on foreign relations at the end of last month, joseph yun, the state departments special representative for north korea policy, said that if north korea went 60 days without testing a missile or a nuclear weapon, it could be a sign that pyongyang was open to dialogue.

apparently they are not so open to dialogue after all. indeed, the north korean launch is a finger in the eye to china, which had just sent a high level envoy to pyongyang at president trumps request. trump tweeted hopefully about the chinese visit: china is sending an envoy and delegation to north korea  a big move, well see what happens! what happened was a big middle finger to beijing and washington from little rocket man.

here is how trump should respond: take out the test site from which the north koreans launched the missile toward japan  just like he struck the military base in syria from which the assad regime had launched a chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.
