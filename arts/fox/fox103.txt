the student newspaper at evergreen state college has a section in its opinion pages described as for people of color by people of color.

this should be a place where we can be us without it being overshadowed by the dark cloud that is living under white supremacy and having to see things from a white perspective. this is why when we do cover these issues it will be in the context and from the perspective of poc and poc only, according to the sections editors as they reintroduced it to readers in september.

the anonymous column, known as poc talk, debuted in the bi-weekly cooper point journal last year and returned this fall to the newspapers pages following racial unrest that erupted at the public university this past spring.

dear white people, please take a step back, this isnt brown-people-answer-white-peoples-questions-hour, were asking specifically for submissions from poc, the sections editors added in their september intro. as being told no seems to be a difficult concept for some of yall i await your emails about the irish, how the term white fragility is mean (great example of white fragility) and how we need to view people through a color-blind lens (just lol). you will 100% not get a response!!!

published in the journals letters & opinion section, poc talk says it provides no-holds-barred commentary on local happenings. in the inaugural poc talk column, it was suggested that a subject touched on in the column could possibly include how do i rid myself of white-dread [sic] roommates numerous micro-agressions.

topics the column has discussed include student activism, self care, the local comedy scene as well as the turmoil that upended the college after students in may accused a white biology professor, bret weinstein, and the university of perpetuating racism.

the cooper point journal did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the column.
