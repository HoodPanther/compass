last week the washington post reported that congress's office of compliance paid out $17 million for 264 settlements with federal employees over 20 years for various violations, including sexual harassment. congress has no human resources department. instead, congressional employees have 180 days to report a sexual harassment incident to the office of compliance, which then leads to a lengthy process that involves counseling and mediation, and requires the signing of a confidentiality agreement before a complaint can go forward. after this an employee can choose to take the matter to federal district court, but another avenue is available: an administrative hearing, after which a negotiation and settlement may follow.

rep. marsha blackburn (r-tn) joined the todd starnes show today to discuss sexual harassment accusations made against congress members, including rep. john conyers (d-mi), and argued that any member of congress who used taxpayer dollars to fund sexual harassment-related settlements needs to "refund that money with interest". rep. blackburn also mentions a new bill she is pushing, sponsored by rep. ron desantis (r-fl) to end "hush funds" used to finance sexual harassment settlements. listen to the full interview below:
