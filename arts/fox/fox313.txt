the museum of the bible is now open to the public in washington, dc. the gala launch event and the ribbon cutting are now in the past, and people have begun filtering through the giant portal, a nearly forty foot replica of the bible's opening words in the book of genesis.

right up until opening day there were still exhibits being installed, walls needing touch up paint, and construction dust wiped away. a few months ago while the sounds of welding and hammering were going on i sat down and talked with cary summers, president of the museum, and charged with shepherding the half billion dollar project to completion. take a listen to what it took to create a 430 thousand square foot museum dedicated to the biggest selling book of all time, the bible.
