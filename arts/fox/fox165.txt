in theory, the holiday spirit is all about giving, not what you get. but that can be a tough sell with kids.

fox's lisa brady reports in this week's 'fox on family':

for kids, the season of giving can be all about getting:

(nuttle) "and nowadays the pressure is so great to have the best toy or the most expensive clothes; it really is a pressure that kids are feeling."

author, speaker and mother-of-three angela nuttle, says it can be easier to give in than draw a line:

(nuttle) "i guarantee that parents can go into their kids' closet; the things that were so important last year, they're just sitting there in a box."

nuttle says she tries to focus on values and doing things together instead of buying things, which can include helping others, maybe visit a nursing home, mindful that the ultimate goal is training our kids for life:

(nuttle) "there are gonna be some painful moments where they don't get what they want, or what they think that they want."

she also urges moms especially, don't drive yourself crazy striving for holiday perfection:

(nuttle) "you know mothers have a tendency to carry this mental load, like they have to do everything, they have to be responsible for everything."

nuttle says that's fueled by baggage, so put it down, allow yourself some boundaries.

angela nuttle is author of the new book 'compose your soul: how to turn your daily chaos into calm control', and ceo of a consulting firm, the corporate talent institute. she also says if kids, or adults, are asking for a lot of expensive things, there may be a deeper need, maybe to feel like they fit in. she recommends figuring out what to replace that need with, to help build-up the person, instead of filling their closet.
