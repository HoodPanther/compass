michael flynns guilty plea friday to a single count of making false statements to the fbi about conversations with russia's ambassador to the u.s., sergey kislyak, does not bode well for the trump administration and for the president and his family personally.

flynn, who briefly served as president trumps national security adviser and earlier was involved in the trump presidential campaign and presidential transition team, promised full cooperation with special counsel robert muellers investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election.

the white house continues to maintain that flynn does not have any information that could implicate or incriminate president trump

court documents show flynn told investigators that a very senior member of the trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments, including russia, about a united nations vote.
