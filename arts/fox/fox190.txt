kim jong un tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in the early hours of wednesday, and the data suggest it could hit all of the continental united states. if north korea is allowed to perfect its warhead technology, it will be able to hold the u.s. hostage to nuclear ransom. the trump administration is right that the u.s. cant live with this threat, so what more should it do to prevent it?

conventional wisdom says that pyongyang already faces extreme economic and diplomatic pressure. but in reality the united nations and u.s. only began to impose broad sanctions last year, and even u.s. allies such as singapore and thailand have been slow to enforce them. china and russia continue to support the kim regimechina through oil exports and other commerce, and russia through payments for north korean slave labor.

shutting down those lifelines should be a top priority. after the norths intermediate-range missile launch in september, the u.s. circulated a draft resolution at the united nations security council to do just that. but russia and china resisted and the u.s. caved; resolution 2375 only capped oil exports and labor contracts. the trump administration portrayed the unanimous vote at the u.n. as a victory, but the resolution kept open many of pyongyangs cash lifelines.
