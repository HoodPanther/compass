since president donald trump took office, he has been consistently strategic in working to dismantle the radical, leftwing legacy of his predecessor.

while the mainstream media has fixated on exaggerated day-to-day mini-controversies, the trump administration has methodically eliminated job-killing obama-era regulations, filled judicial vacancies with solid conservatives at an astonishing pace, and accomplished real breakthroughs in trade relations with china and the middle east.

now, the president is going after another obama-era creation: the dangerously unaccountable consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb).

long time readers of this newsletter know that i have opposed the cfpb on constitutional and economic grounds for years. ive written about the agencys mafia-like tactics as well as the threat its behavior poses to the rule of law. i have even testified before congress about the danger this agency poses.

this cfpb was created by the 2010 dodd-frank act and was largely designed by radical senator elizabeth warren when she was an obama advisor. since the beginning, it has been used as a political weapon by the far left as a way to intimidate businesses that the left opposes ideologically.

the cfpb consistently oversteps its bounds. it is prohibited from regulating car deals, yet it does so anyway. it is prohibited from collecting personal data from consumers, yet it does so at a scale that rivals the nsas most controversial data gathering operations.

further, the cfpb draws its funding from the federal reserves operating expenses rather than annual appropriations  making it unaccountable to congress. the writers of dodd-frank also specified that the director could only be removed by the president  and only under specific circumstances. this undermines both congressional and executive powers. essentially, the bureau can do whatever it wants  without fear of losing its funding or its leadership.
