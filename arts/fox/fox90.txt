j. crew and model respond to criticism over 'wrong' hairstyle

big job, big scissors, desmarre says of his theatrical style.

the hair stylist has been doing hair for a decade, and told yahoo lifestyle he love[s] transformations.

i dont do it for myself. i do it for the client. i want to give them the best transformation they can, he added.

well, according to the video of him using the distinctive clippers, those on social media are loving it too. the recording of desmarre cutting 19-year-old kendal fedails waist-length hair with the large scissors has already reached more than 3 million views on instragram.

commenters left encouraging words like, thats the best way to do it, and love this.

desmarre said he's brought out the special scissors, which take two hands to manage, about three times in the last six months. but, he isnt the only one in the salon who uses them. sometimes the shops owner, larisa love, will try her hands at giving a big chop.
