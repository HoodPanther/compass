illegal immigrants appear to have "ambushed" two u.s. border patrol agents near the texas border with mexico and bashed their heads with blunt objects -- possibly rocks -- killing one agent and sending another to a hospital in serious condition sunday, a national border patrol council (nbpc) official told fox news. rogelio martinez, 36, was killed and another agent, who has not been identified, was injured while they were patrolling the big bend sector, leading authorities to scour west texas for the attackers, officials said. although few details about the incident have been released, brandon judd, the president of the nbpc, told fox news on monday it appeared martinez and the second agent were "ambushed" by a group of illegal immigrants. "we don't know exactly what happened because we weren't there. however, just from agents that were working in the area, reports are saying it was an attack and it would appear to be an ambush," judd said. he added: "there's a high likelihood this was an assault on the agents."
