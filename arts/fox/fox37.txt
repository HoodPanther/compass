the force is officially with fashion lovers!

rag & bone and disney have officially launched their much-anticipated star wars collaboration, ahead of the dec. 15 premiere of the last jedi.

we wanted the pieces to feel like something that referenced star wars but that also fit the rag & bone aesthetic, like a modern jedi, rag & bone designer  and self-professed star wars fan  marcus wainwright says in a press release.

the limited-edition designs, which nod to the galactic empire and rebel alliance, could fit in as easily on the runway as they could at comic con.

pieces range from an obi-wan kenobi hoodie in tatooine (a shade of sand, referring to the desert planet from the films) to a black stormtrooper sweatshirt with red markings.

the standout item is definitely the echo jacket in hoth, which will cost fans a cool $1,295. the padded jacket with lace-up detail can be paired with matching pants for an additional $695  a look sure to keep you nice and warm, on the ice planet of hoth or here on earth.

superfans of the film will be happy to know that there are also limited-edition t-shirts  one available per day, from dec. 1 through dec. 4. they run at a more affordable range, from $95 to $150  and are more obviously themed than some of the collections other pieces (see: the black t-shirt with white x-wing starfighters).
