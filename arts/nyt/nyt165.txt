president trump says that premiums for obamacare are going up, up, up. he is partly correct and partly incorrect, according to a new york times analysis of new data provided by the mckinsey center for u.s. health system reform.

why trump is right

the median rise in premiums for bronze plans was 18 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to mckinsey.

how much the monthly cost of a bronze plan changed from last year +$50 +$150 +$300 wash. me. n.d. n.h. ore. wis. n.y. s.d. wyo. mich. conn. iowa neb. nev. ohio md. del. utah ind. ill. w.va. colo. calif. va. mo. ky. n.m. ga. miss. la. tex. fla. hawaii +$50 +$150 +$300 wash. me. n.d. n.h. ore. wis. n.y. s.d. wyo. mich. conn. iowa neb. nev. ohio md. del. utah ind. ill. w.va. colo. calif. va. mo. ky. n.m. ga. miss. la. tex. fla. hawaii +$50 +$150 +$300 data is for the lowest-cost bronze plan for a 40-year-old earning $30,000.

in many places, the cost of a bronze plan, which generally has high deductibles but low premiums, is at least $50 more a month than last year for a 40-year-old earning $30,000.

why trump is also wrong

about half of americans who buy their own health insurance qualify for subsidies that insulate them from the price increases. the subsidies are designed to increase if premiums rise.

for those customers, the cost of the lowest-price silver plan may actually go down compared with this year in a majority of counties.

trump is at least partly to blame

insurers have attributed much of this years increases to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the affordable care act. mr. trump has actively taken steps to scaling back the law, including ending certain subsidies to insurers, which allowed them to give discounts to low-income consumers.

average monthly premium gold $620 silver $521 bronze $403 $319 $266 $212 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 data is for the lowest-cost plan in each tier for a 40-year-old earning $30,000.

to make up for the lost funding, insurance companies increased the price of their plans, most steeply for the silver plans, though other plans also saw double-digit increases.

and heres the twist

mr. trumps actions have caused one unexpected result. there are now some places where the gold plan is less expensive than the silver, so some people can actually find better coverage for a lower price.

where a gold plan is less expensive than silver, after subsidies wash. wis. wyo. mich. pa. md. calif. kan. n.m. ga. tex. wash. wis. wyo. mich. pa. md. calif. kan. n.m. ga. tex. data is for the lowest-cost plan in each tier for a 40-year-old earning $30,000.

in the past, the least expensive gold plans have always cost more than the least expensive silver ones.
