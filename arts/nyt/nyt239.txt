ithaca, n.y.  long before he made a fortune and helped found the ivy league university here, ezra cornell assembled a crew that used gunpowder to blast through the wall of a gorge. cornell, who was 23 at the time, led the men in the summer of 1830 as they burrowed through 200 feet of rock next to a towering waterfall.

a dam was built to divert a stream and water gushed through the cavern, helping to power the mills that once lined the gorge. but with the dam crumbling and the mills long gone, the tunnel has run dry and these days cornell university students and others cascade through the secluded cavern known as ezras tunnel, which lies just off campus.

on warm days, visitors emerge from the tunnel a stones throw from a 15-story drop over ithaca falls and a short walk downstream from forest falls, a 25-foot waterfall that flows into a picturesque, rocky pool where swimming is popular, but illegal and dangerous.

in the past seven years, two cornell students have drowned in the water near the tunnel, most recently a teenager from the bronx who died in august. now the 187-year-old tunnel is the subject of a heated debate with opinions as pronounced as the caverns jagged shale edges.

cornell officials have proposed installing a steel gate at the opening of the tunnel  blocking the only entrance to a section of fall creek gorge stretching from the top of ithaca falls to the swimming area below forest falls  and the city council is scheduled to vote on the proposal on wednesday.
