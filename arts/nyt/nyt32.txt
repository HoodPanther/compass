special post  weve done a lot of celebrating this year, because 75 years of new york times crossword puzzles  and were still going strong  is quite a lot to celebrate. one of the bright lights in this celebration has been the series of crosswords made by celebrity and veteran constructor teams, paired up by crosswords editor will shortz.

all of the celebrities that created puzzles for the new york times were avid solvers, but none had undertaken the task of constructing a crossword before, except for former president bill clinton, who had a slight advantage after making one with constructor cathy allis (then millhauser) for the new york times magazine in 2007 (answers to that puzzle are here). each celebrity expressed surprise at how difficult it was to create a new york times-worthy crossword, but they all had this in common: they stuck with it and they are now published new york times crossword constructors.

this list will be updated as more celebrity crosswords are published.
