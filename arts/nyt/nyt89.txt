 in afghanistan, our kabul bureau chief went inside a provincial prison to meet meena, 11, who was born there and has never been outside, not even for a brief visit.

meenas mother is a convicted serial killer serving a life sentence, and under afghan prison policy she can keep her daughter with her until the girl turns 18. advocates estimate that there are hundreds of children similarly stuck behind bars.

back story

the new york times headline was unassuming in its brevity: claude monet dies; famous painter.

a week after the french artist died on this day in 1926, a times article was more effusive, praising monet as one of the names in the history of art to which will be attached a single idea, the idea of light.

born in 1840, monet was famous for outdoor scenes and for reproducing the effects of light, whether on water lilies, haystacks or the cities of europe.

impressionism, the name of the movement he helped found in the 1870s, was derived from impression, sunrise, the title of his painting of the harbor of le havre in france. coined derisively by a critic, the name was adopted by monet and his fellow impressionists, including pierre auguste renoir and camille pissarro.

almost a century after his death, monet still captures the publics imagination. last year, his painting meule fetched $81.4 million with fees at christies, a new auction high for his work. the painting of a grainstack at sunset reflected the artists long fascination with light.

these landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me, monet wrote in 1909. it is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet i want to render what i feel.
