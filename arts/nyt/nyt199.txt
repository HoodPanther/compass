when gail collins first started writing opinion pieces, she was a self-described yeller. she would yell and yell and yell, offering an authoritative lecture to readers about why or how they should care about a given topic. but that didnt last long.

after a while i thought, i would like to write something that doesnt make people want to throw themselves out the window in the morning, ms. collins said. her goal as an opinion writer came into focus: get people interested in important issues of the day, with the right balance of fact and thoughtful analysis. a touch of her signature dry humor helped, too.

ms. collins has had her biweekly opinion column in the times since 2000 (she then became the sections editorial page director, before returning to her columns in 2007). now, alongside colleagues like nicholas kristof and ross douthat, she is one of 13 columnists charged with guiding readers through the events of the moment.

columnists, who are on staff at the times and typically produce two columns a week, represent an especially visible component of the daily opinion section, which also includes regularly contributing outside writers, an expanding video and graphics component and several editors responsible for picking up quick pieces in response to breaking news. it also encompasses the editorial board, an independent body of 13 that crafts daily unsigned editorials that represent the official opinion of the paper.

the opinion section operates editorially independently from the rest of the newspaper. it is the sections unique mission both to be the voice of the times, and to challenge it. the op-ed pages were born, in part, because of the closing of new yorks top conservative newspaper, the new york herald tribune. they were created to be opposite the editorial pages  and not just physically.
