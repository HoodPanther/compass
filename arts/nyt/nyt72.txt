monday puzzle  heres a hot take: from my constructing experience, i find monday crosswords the hardest to create. a quintessential early-week offering should have a theme simple enough to draw in new solvers, yet interesting enough to captivate the regular audience. not only is this balance difficult to achieve, but originality is still as important as it is with other puzzles. finally, theres a major emphasis on the fill being widely familiar to all; a tough crossing may pop up on a weekend puzzle, but this is essentially taboo for monday.

although alan arbesfeld is best known for constructing midweek and sunday puzzles, he executes the above concepts well for a textbook monday solve. and its no wonder; this is mr. arbesfelds 119th crossword in the new york times, making him one of the most prolific constructors since will shortz became puzzles editor in 1993.

todays theme

five across entries start with the pattern [word ending in -ay] + it as follows:

17a:  tell me the rumors are false!  = say it aint so

28a: 2000 kevin spacey/helen hunt film = pay it forward

38a: oscar-nominated enya song from 2001s the lord of the rings  = may it be

48a: offer effusive praise = lay it on thick

62a: improvise = play it by ear

see what i mean about being simply original? the theme concept is about as straightforward as mondays go, and yet this arrangement in particular has never been used for a times puzzle before. in addition, all five entries are nice and fresh. may it be was new to me, but modern oscar-nominated music is always worth knowing, and enya, with her constructor-friendly letter pattern, shows up in so many puzzles besides. i love learning new things, so that answer was my favorite of the bunch. what was yours?
