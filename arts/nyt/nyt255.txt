variety puzzle  how do you solve an acrostic, if this is your first time diving into one of these puzzles?

elementary, my dear solver, especially if you are solving online, which i highly recommend. you begin by scanning the clue list for things you know, like capote for author of a 1966 true crime novel, or fisheye for wide-angle, as lenses go. you can put in club for sandwich with many synonyms, but the answer is really hero. what makes a man? is wordplay for y chromosome, which may be true from a biological standpoint, but is not a terribly inclusive way of saying it. im sure our friends in the transgender community would argue that point.

once you have a few gimmes in place, look at the grid  which now has some letters from your gimmes filled in  and see if you can complete some of the shorter words. _t has to be it or at. __r has to be or. as you fill these in using context and process of elimination, note that some of the letters are being filled in next to the clues below to help you solve them. thats what acrostic solvers call toggling between the grid and the clues, and this is what will help you solve the entire puzzle so you can read the acrostic quote.

lets hear from our constructors:

constructor notes

the sherlock holmes stories generate lovely acrostic-length passages. in december 2000 we featured this from his last bow: his incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his  revolver practice within doors, his weird  scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of  danger  around him  made him the very worst tenant in london. and as recently as 2014 we lifted this from the adventure of the musgrave ritual: although  methodical  [he] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very center of his wooden mantelpiece. now well give the old sleuth a break for a spell.
