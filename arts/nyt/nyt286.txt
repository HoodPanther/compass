variety puzzle  fred piscop is one of the best in the business, so my eyes lit up when i heard that this weekends variety would be one of his signature split decision puzzles. mr. piscop sharpens our pattern recognition abilities with each construction, which i think is crucial to solving normal crossword puzzles, especially when the cluing is difficult.

the best bit of advice i have about todays puzzle is to be wary before entering letters to shorter word splits, and to instead search for unusual letter blends that bear less possibilities. for instance, take the seven-letter answer with the split ?mi????/?ff????. we know that the first letter must be a vowel, for no consonants can precede two fs, and that the fourth letter is most likely a vowel as well. with these constraints, we can eventually deduce that the split is amiable/affable.

however, when the split is shorter, as with ?ix/?ay, it is important to keep all possibilities open where appropriate. sure, s works well, but so do m, n, f and perhaps p. when arsenal/arsenic in the top-left corner becomes obvious, then the n will be filled in correctly, but until then, its best to refrain from guessing without some sort of logic behind it.

today i learned that potpies can be written as a single word, and that codfish and commish are only two letters apart. as an avid fantasy football league manager, i enjoyed seeing the latter  the colloquial term for commissioner  in a new york times puzzle.
