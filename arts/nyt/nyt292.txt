in one more sign that north atlantic right whales are struggling, a new study finds sky-high levels of stress in animals that have been caught in fishing nets.

researchers determined the stress hormone levels of more than 100 north atlantic right whales over a 15-year period by examining their feces. sometimes guided by sniffing dogs, researchers followed the animals, collecting waste samples that they then analyzed in their lab at the new england aquarium.

results from the feces of 113 seemingly healthy whales helped establish a baseline of stress hormone levels, which had never before been known for the species. we have a good idea of what normal is now, said rosalind rolland, who developed the research technique and is the lead author of the study published in the journal endangered species research.

she then compared these baselines to hormone levels in the feces of six whales that had become entangled in fishing lines, and one that had been stranded for several days, finding that those animals were off-the-charts anxious.

one whale, a young female named bayla, showed stress levels eight times higher after she was found entangled in synthetic fishing ropes in january 2011. several biologists trained in disentanglement couldnt get all the gear off her, so they sedated the emaciated animal and gave her antibiotics. two weeks later, an aerial survey team found her corpse floating at sea, possibly after being attacked by sharks, which typically leave healthy animals alone. a necropsy conducted a few days later found rope embedded in the back of baylas throat, that possibly prevented her from eating.

this highlights the extreme physical suffering these animals are going through when theyre entangled in fishing lines, said dr. rolland, a senior scientist in the ocean health and marine stress lab at the anderson cabot center for ocean life at the new england aquarium.
