sunday puzzle  its rare that a crossword puzzle spills its answers completely in the revealer, but if you have a sharp eye, youll see it today.

all you need to solve this puzzle are some fingers. maybe some toes.

todays theme

oh, and it helps to follow the instructions. tom mccoy is back and he would like you to count the answer lengths of the theme entries, as it says in the revealer at 110a.

for example, 110a asks us to count the number of letters in each theme answer and, at 22a, the clue reads this clues 110-across, timewise. count up the letters in the answer midnight hour, and you get 12, which is, indeed, the midnight hour. similarly, at 28a, the divers goal at the olympics is 10/10, and there are 10 letters in divers goal.

is there more? you can count on it. the four-letter bonus entry in the circled squares spells out four, which is the only number that is its own length long (mr. mccoy explains that better in his notes below).
