several years ago, jenna lyons walked into the london living room of samantha cameron, wife of then british prime minister david cameron, and experienced dj vu. didnt this apartment, with its dramatic dark-gray cabinetry and vivid upholstery, look very much like her own former home  the five-story park slope, brooklyn, brownstone that, after appearing in a 2008 issue of domino magazine, was among the most-pinned interiors on all of pinterest? cameron admitted to the homage immediately. she was like, yes! it was totally taken from your living room,  lyons recalls. she had the yellow couches, the whole thing.

from her slicked-back ponytail and chunky eyeglasses to her love of acid-bright hues (a lemon blazer here, an electric orange lipstick there), lyonss style has been copied down to its smallest detail. thats due in part to her innate approachability  her skill at mixing unexpected elements to achieve a look that feels fanciful if not quite fancy  but also to an act of brilliant corporate image-making: throughout her eight years as president and decade as creative director of j.crew, the company made her singular aesthetic achievable, convincing its customers that they, too, could mix coral coats with torn jeans and sequined heels.

this past april, the 49-year-old lyons departed the company after 27 years. shed started as an assistant mens wear designer right out of college, but by 2014, profits had tumbled, and j.crew had become a symbol of brick-and-mortar retails global decline. faced with the first stretch of aimlessness in her adult life, she spent three months jumping from the pool to the couch to the kitchen to the pool at her house upstate in berryville, n.y.  while refusing to jump into any decisions about her next steps. it took me the summer to decompress and think about whats important to me, lyons says. is it making big shifts, or doing something small? while there have been offers, she says, she hasnt seriously entertained any of them yet, nor is she planning to any time soon.

instead, lyons has been spending her days in her newly redesigned apartment, a 3,500-square-foot loft on the fourth floor of a 19th-century cast-iron building in soho. much has happened in lyonss world, not just professionally, in the six years since she sold the brooklyn townhouse that made zebra-hide rugs a more popular (and populist) necessity than they might have previously been: her 2011 divorce from artist-turned-restaurateur vincent mazeau was followed by a relationship with courtney crangi  co-founder, with her brother philip, of the n.y.c.-based jewelry line giles & brother  that has since come to an end.

after purchasing her apartment in 2012, lyons spent a year in a rental down the street, the better to oversee every aspect of the lofts transformation from a drab artists studio, with yellowing floors and featureless walls, into a heavily accessorized, sumptuously textured home that might feel familiar to her many acolytes. for lyons, the effort that went into pulling off that specific mix was as satisfying as the result  the real goal was having it look like something youve never seen before, she says.

walking off the elevator into lyonss apartment, one is greeted by a living area that blends eclectic modernism (monstera deliciosa leaves, leopard-print poufs) with a bit of old world paris (antiqued mirrors, toile-printed panels): its feminine without being sweet, busy but not forced. the room is also gloriously sunny, thanks to five eight-foot-high, west-facing windows.

on display throughout is lyonss signature playfulness, from the giant, gold-foil numeral 10 left over from her son becketts birthday, to the framed geometric prints by fred sandback leaning casually against the fireplace, to the rooms showpiece: an original drawing by her favorite artist, cy twombly, announcing a 1979 show of his work at yvon lamberts paris gallery. still, interiors buffs who memorized every nuance of her park slope house will detect a deeper richness, as if here, lyons has permitted herself to unfurl into the tactile luxury that comes with real achievement. the cozy softness of the rooms milky gray walls, the pale oak herringbone parquet floors  after much deliberation, left unsealed to develop a patina  the verdigris side table that contrasts against a massive couch in what she calls a truly faded-out persimmon pink: all speak to lyonss idiosyncratic genius for color and texture, but also to her exacting and precise eye, one trained over years superintending dozens of store openings and developing an understanding for how a space is meant to spotlight only the most central elements.
