philadelphia  as the garagelike door rolled up at the 23rd street armory here on sunday evening, 400 student, amateur and professional musicians paraded in with just a helping of the broken instruments that have spent years languishing in this citys strapped public school system.

a trumpet was held together with blue painters tape. a violin, stripped of much of its body, had been reduced to a silhouette. more than one cello was carried in multiple pieces.

these were the unlikely ingredients of symphony for a broken orchestra, a new piece by the pulitzer prize-winning composer david lang. it was written as part of a project of the same name to repair more than 1,000 damaged instruments that had been doomed to silence in storage because of severe budget cuts to philadelphias public school music programs.

robert blackson, the director of temple contemporary at the tyler school of art, was the projects mastermind and said that teachers around the city had been stockpiling the instruments in case the funding to fix them ever materialized. to mr. lang, who said in an interview he owes his career to public school music education, those instruments represent over 1,000 missed opportunities.

the teachers often dont have the skills to do the repairs themselves, mr. blackson said, and they have had to reckon with the near evaporation of the school districts funding for arts programs, excluding teachers salaries, which dropped from $1.3 million in 2007 to $50,000 this year. the students hit hardest, he added, were almost entirely low-income minorities.

colin chen, a 24-year-old music teacher who played a clarinet in mr. langs symphony, said that he tries to the make the best of very little resources by paying for supplies out of his own pocket.
