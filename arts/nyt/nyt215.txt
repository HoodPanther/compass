saturday puzzle  you may have wondered: why doesnt will shortz simply make and edit every puzzle himself? why can anyone submit a puzzle to the new york times? while its true that mr. shortz would have a much tougher time churning out consistently high-quality work, the real reason stems from the variety that different constructors voices can provide.

todays puzzle by sam trabucco is an excellent illustration of this point. check out some of the answers that his grid is built around: the otter pup / puh-lease / uberpool stack, the pokmon-inspired gotta catch em all, the ha ha ha / yeah dude commentary and the fan favorite chase utley.

not only are the answers above ideal for a themeless puzzle, but they appear to convey mr. trabuccos voice; its as if hes right there watching us solve. isnt that neat? while i have had the pleasure of meeting mr. trabucco once in person, i feel i know a lot more about his interests after completing his puzzle. and this is just one constructors output; with nearly 900 contributors since mr. shortz began in 1993, its no wonder we see so many different kinds of entries that inspire both themed and themeless grids.

of course, this discussion should not detract from mr. trabuccos work here today. there is so much to like in his 70-word grid, and i learned things like arm bar and the last emperor, too. personally, i found it easier than yesterdays themeless, yet i understand why it was slotted as a saturday rather than friday: several answers here are trivia-based. either you know uberpool or you dont. same deal with gotta catch em all, data type and chase utley. it also explains why their clues are so straightforward; the solver will have an easier way in.

16a: speaking of straightforward clues  response to a riot is exactly the opposite. here, riot is referring to a laughable matter (ha ha ha) rather than the more straight-forward rioting in the streets meaning.
