please like me

where to watch: hulu



this australian coming-of-age comedy blends its sweet disposition with its unsentimental view of the world, creating room for both darling goofballs and catastrophic depression. its thoughtful and welcoming, often hilarious and just oddball enough.

regina king won two emmys for her performances on this drama anthology, and she should have won a third for this final season, where she played a devoted but weary social worker.

girls

where to watch: amazon prime, hbo



a lightning-rod show from before it even premiered, girls died as it lived: surrounded by angry blog posts but also telling some stories in an extraordinarily deft fashion.

downward dog

where to watch: amazon, itunes



downward dog only aired eight episodes, but that was enough to solidify its place in the one-and-done hall of fame. the shows specialty was its tender approach to ordinariness, its baked-in knowledge that what makes a dog special  or an owner special, or a friend special  is that theyre yours.

orphan black

where to watch: amazon prime



orphan black was the rare sci-fi thriller with an emotional core, thanks in large part to its star, tatiana maslany. while the shows intricate plotting could drift to the arcane, particularly in later seasons, the series never gave up its central humanity  or its occasional, welcome moments of humor.

underground

where to watch: hulu



this historical drama about slavery and the underground railroad was frequently devastating and disturbing  and sometimes sudsy and juicy. but the standout episode by far was this seasons minty, essentially a full-episode monologue performed by aisha hinds as harriet tubman.

playing house

where to watch: amazon



after an almost two-year hiatus, playing house returned for a third season in 2017  a season that lasted a mere four weeks. thanks for nothing, usa. the comedy, created by and starring jessica st. clair and lennon parham, was both gentle and goofy.

sweet/vicious and switched at birth

these shows are at opposite sides of the teen-tv spectrum: sweet/vicious was slick and snarky and barely eked out 10 episodes, while switched at birth could be painfully earnest and enjoyed a 104-episode run. (watch sweet/vicious on amazon or itunes, and switched at birth on netflix.)

american vandal

where to watch: netflix

like an obscene image spray-painted on your car, this docu-parody was an out-of-nowhere surprise, but in this case a welcome one. it began as a raunchy sendup of true-crime documentaries and ended up a surprisingly moving study of pigeonholing kids.

better things

where to watch: fx, hulu

pamela adlon elevated the second season of her comedy into a raw and poetic story of the feverish love-hate relationship between three generations of mothers and daughters. the show is devastating without being sentimental, and ms. adlons sam fox is one of the best character studies on tv today.

crazy ex-girlfriend

where to watch: netflix

the third season, beginning this fall, interrogated the crazy in rachel blooms musical comedy of obsession by exploring her character rebeccas diagnosis with borderline personality disorder  while still delivering multiple spot on song parodies a week.

the deuce

where to watch: hbo

a drama about the 1970s sex business, on a channel with a penchant for salacious sex, could have gone wrong in many ways. it went right, very right, because the creators treated sex work as work: an economic system with dangers, calculations and financial and physical pressures.

the good place

where to watch: hulu, netflix

this afterlife comedy, about a group of misfits in a troubled paradise, is full of twists, but its real appeal is a top-notch cast performing prime times most entertaining philosophy lesson.

lady dynamite

where to watch: netflix

the second season of maria bamfords first-person comedy used fractured storytelling to capture the experience of living and working with bipolar disorder from all angles. (all while working in a brilliant satire of netflix, on netflix.)

the leftovers

where to watch: hbo

the last season of this series about faith, loss and mystery was constructed like an octagonal chapel, each of its eight episodes a stained-glass window lit with emotion and humor.

twin peaks: the return

where to watch: showtime



sure, the reunion of david lynch and mark frost had a nominal plot: the odyssey of dale cooper (kyle maclachlan)back from the otherworldly waiting room where hed spent the last 25 years. but mainly it was a direct download from the subconscious of mr. lynch: part horror story, part slapstick, all twisted fantasy.

humans

where to watch: amazon prime

even more tense and moving in its second season than in its excellent debut, channel 4s drama about intelligent androids at odds with the (for now) dominant human society is the robot allegory you should be watching.

chewing gum

where to watch: netflix

some of the best shows around are in the category of personal, if not autobiographical, comedies by female writer-actresses. the most raucous and wildly funny is michaela coels chewing gum, about a very demonstrative young woman in a london housing project trying very hard to lose her virginity.

line of duty

where to watch: acorn tv, hulu

stranger

where to watch: netflix

full disclosure: this is an affirmative-action slot, recognizing the ubiquity and popularity of south korean dramas. the murder mystery stranger has two other big advantages over most k-dramas: its only eight episodes long and it stars the immensely likable bae doo-na as a fearless cop.
