tuesday puzzle  every now and then, a new constructor comes roaring around the bend and shows us how to make puzzle construction look effortless. brian thomas offers us a puzzle with a theme that might not seem entirely original, but enough time has elapsed since the last one and mr. thomas theme is different and tighter than the older one so that i could give it a pass.

im glad i did. this is a really nice debut that makes good use of a simple theme and some decent fill.

todays theme

what i liked about mr. thomas theme, beside the smooth solve, is that its a story  and i love stories. that in itself helps the theme hang together, and today we are watching an international car race. once you get one theme entry you can probably guess the rest of them; theyre old puns but put together, the theme winds up being fun.

as the race starts at 19a, the car from warsaw pulls into first, or pole into first. at 30a, you can hear the car from moscow russian past. ill let you discover who wins, and point you instead to the debuts of bone mass and scrunchie.
