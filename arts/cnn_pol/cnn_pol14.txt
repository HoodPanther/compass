(cnn) sen. richard blumenthal said monday that president donald trump's tweet over the weekend saying he fired former national security adviser michael flynn because he lied to the fbi is "very powerful evidence of obstruction of justice."

in a saturday tweet, trump said: "i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi. he has pled guilty to those lies. it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. there was nothing to hide!"
