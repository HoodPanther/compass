the herv pierre skirt is a favorite of melanias. she previously donned the same skirt, but in brown, during the pardoning of the thanksgiving turkey, breitbart news reported.

melania first wore the perfectly-fitted herv pierre leather skirt when she departed for her first foreign trip with president trump. during her walk towards air force one, melania stunned in the rich, orange skirt, pairing it once again with a ribbed max mara sweater.
