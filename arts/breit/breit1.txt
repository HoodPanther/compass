actress roseanne barr slammed sen. al franken (d-mi) during his resignation speech on thursday, pointing out that the disgraced democrat was blaming trump for his being a pervert.

i, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that i am leaving, while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office, franken said during his speech on the senate floor.

the minnesota democrat has been accused by eight separate women of sexual misconduct, primarily in the form of groping and harassment.

barr, who was the 2012 presidential nominee of the california-based left-wing peace and freedom party, has previously defended president trump from relentless media attacks, which she claimed were really disguised attacks on american voters.

every single attack on @potus is really a disguised attack on american voters who rejected obama-clinton-bushs bleeding of r treasury, barr tweeted in march.

barr was also a prominent critic of hillary clinton, saying in the run-up to last years election that america would be so lucky if trump won because then it wouldnt be hillary.

in may, it was revealed that barrs hit 1990s television show roseanne, which revolves around the lives of a working-class family from illinois, would return for another eight-episode season.
