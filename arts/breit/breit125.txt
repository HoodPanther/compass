merkley said, well, certainly he has not had a chance to go through the ethics process where the facts are really looked at, at closely. were going to have circumstances in the future where were going to really have to wrestle with this. where theres a report or two, what is the line? theres not a clear line here.

but what we do know is thisthat the individual roy moore, running in alabama, has done things that are incredibly egregious, and he should drop out of that race right now, he continued. and by the way, for that matter, the president should resign, because he certainly has a track record, with more than 17 women, of horrific conduct.
