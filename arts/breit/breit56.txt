on frankens resignation, brzezinski said i just have an incredibly uneasy feeling about this entire story, to be honest. i tried to say that once yesterday, and it was as if a bomb went off.

after her co-host joe scarborough defended her saying she criticized former president bill clinton over his sexual misconduct at the time, brzezinski continued, im concerned about women, who are legitimately sexually harassed in the workplace across america, and where this is taking us.

she added, weve never really talked about the woman who first came out against al franken, who is in the picture that you say susan is just the death nail. i would think a dress owned by monica lewinsky, would bring down a president but it didnt. so im surprised that you think a comedians picture of a performer, playboy model who goes on hannity, who voted for trump. i see some politics there, but i havent brought that up every step of the way because, of course, in this me too environment, you must always just believe the women. and i think that theres a lot of reasons why we need to look at the women seriously and believe them, in many cases. like, for example, i spoke to accusers of mark halperin, in which he admits a lot of what hes accused of doing. i spoke to them, i believe them. im just wondering if all the women need to be believed. im concerned that we are being the judge the jury and the cops here and so did senate democrats getting ahead of their skis.
