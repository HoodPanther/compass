dupuy said, i thought that he said to listen to women, and then he talked about himself. it wasnt an apology. it was very defiant. he wanted to talk about the pain that he was going through, which is obvious. but not the pain that hes inflicted. so  and i think  i thought that was inappropriate to do that from the senate floor, quite candidly.

she also stated that it wasnt irony that franken resigned while president trump and alabama republican senate nominee roy moore stayed, its one party being better on women than the other party.
