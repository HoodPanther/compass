partial transcript as follows:

reporter: to follow up on your answer to a dreamer question earlier, are you backing off your stance from last month where you said, we will not leave here in december without a daca fix?

pelosi: no, i stand by that statement. we will not leave here without a daca fix. yes, maam?

reporter: two questions. back on dacahave you changed your mind at all about being willing to accept some border wall funding or immigration crackdown funding within a dream act fix?

pelosi: when you say, have you changed your mind, we said to the president the night he agreed to the daca legislation that we have a responsibility to protect our border and we think there are many things we can do, working together to do that, and members have been working in a bipartisan way to address that. so, were not backing off anything, and including meeting the needs of protecting our border. we are not going to turn this country into a reign of terror of domestic enforcement, and have the daca. the dreamers pay that price. but im optimistic. i always have been. god is with us on this. our country is great. we know their greatness springs from the vitality that newcomers bring to our country. eighty percent at least of the american people support the dreamers. some members at the presidents holiday event the other nighthe calls it a holiday event, by the wayit wasnt a christmas party, it was a holiday event. republican members were saying to me, this is 80 percent in my district, people support the dreamers. i had some of their spouses say, we have to get the dream act. again, this is bipartisan support. we can find our common ground.
