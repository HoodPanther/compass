he even disses the falcons while promoting childrens books.

the patriots wide receiver made an instagram video thursday, promoting his new book: flying high 2. his second childrens title was released on friday. the book is a collaborative effort, between edelman and assaf swissa. it is illustrated by david leonard and published by superdigital.

28 hours, 3 minutes to go #flyinghigh2, edelman wrote in the caption for the video post.

the post features edelman closing the book after reading it. he then goes back to his laptop to make some edits. edelmans post has more than 162,000 likes and some interesting comments.

usa gymnastics star aly raisman posted a laughing emoji in the comments. the wife of edelmans teammate jerod mayo posted two fire emojis.

flying high 2 features a squirrel named jules. squirrel also happens to be edelmans nickname. it also features a goat named tom. goat is generally used as an acronym for greatest of all time, when it comes to sports figures.

its 28-3 and the falcons are winning, the book description reads on edelmans website. all jules the squirrel has to do, is believe. this is a true story.

the 28-3 reference is a blatant call out to the falcons super bowl li choke on feb. 5. atlanta led before new england scored 31 unanswered points to claim the victory at nrg stadium. edelman made one of the best plays of the game with a 23-yard catch in the fourth quarter. the patriots were able to tie the game on the drive, before winning 34-28.
