white house press secretary sarah sanders told reporters that president donald trump set a good example for how women should be treated in the workplace.

certainly, as a woman myself, ive never felt anything but treated with the highest level of respect and been empowered to do my job, she said. and i think thats what ive seen the president do, day in and day out, since weve been here and during the campaign.

sanders said that trumps actions were a pretty good example of how women should be treated in the workplace.

she confirmed that employees were reminded of legal expectations of serving in the white house, but also personal expectations.

i think all of us expect each person to live up and to meet those policies, and to not cross a line that is not only not legal but not appropriate or not ethical, she concluded.
