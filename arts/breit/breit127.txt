president donald trump approved a declaration of a state of emergency in california on friday, ordering federal assistance in response to multiple wildfires that have broken out and continue to cause massive damage in the state since december 4.

this declaration allows the department of homeland securitys federal emergency management agency (fema) to coordinate all disaster relief efforts, according to a white house statement on the declaration.

the statement continued:

this action will help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population, and provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under title v of the stafford act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of los angeles, riverside, san diego, santa barbara, and ventura.

fema now has the authority to identify, mobilize, and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency.

emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding, according to the statement.

mark armstrong has been named federal coordinating officer for federal recovery operations for the fire-ravaged areas.

at least ten fires are specifically identified on a calfire map of southern california. some of those have been contained, while most have not. updates including evacuations can be found on the calfire incident information webpage.
