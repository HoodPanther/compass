(ap)  minnesota gov. mark daytons preferred appointee to fill sen. al frankens senate seat, lt. gov. tina smith, is considering also running for the seat next year, as dayton is being pressured by top democrats in washington to appoint more than a mere caretaker, according to two democrats familiar with the discussions.

franken said thursday he would resign over allegations of sexual harassment, leaving dayton to appoint a replacement until a special election next november to complete frankens term, which runs through 2020.

daytons initial inclination was to pick smith, a longtime aide and his second-in-command since 2015, to serve as a caretaker until next years election, a democratic official told the associated press. the official requested anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss private deliberations surrounding the appointment before daytons announcement.

the official said senate minority leader chuck schumer has reached out to dayton and pressured him to instead appoint someone who can use the opportunity as a running start for a 2018 campaign.

a senior senate democratic aide confirmed that senate democrats do not want a placeholder appointee. the aide spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss private discussions.

amid that pushback, smith is now considering running for the seat next year, according to the official and a separate democratic operative familiar with the discussions surrounding the appointment. smith had previously explored a run for minnesota governor in 2018, when daytons second and final term ends, but she ruled it out this spring.

smith did not immediately reply to a text or voicemail seeking comment.

speaking to reporters earlier friday, dayton reiterated he plans to make the appointment in the next couple days but would not discuss the factors or candidates he is weighing.
