on thursdays msnbc live, stephanie kemplin, one of senator al frankens (d-mn) accusers, criticized franken for failing to take responsibility for his actions, including trying to pass the buck onto other individuals, who possibly  they did commit the same things, maybe even more heinous than what hes done.

anchor chris jansing asked, as you watch what happened today, is this justice?

kemplin answered, no, i think, you know, what is justice in this situation? its just sad overall. his resignation is just one of the consequences for what hes put us through.

jansing then asked, and so is there anything that for you would be justice?

kemplin responded, i have to say that im so sad and appalled at his lack of response and him owning up to what he did. i feel that he just keeps passing the buck and making it out to be something that we took his behavior the wrong way, or we misconstrued something, or that were just  weve just flat-out lied about what happened to us. and i  justice to me would be him owning up to what he did, and to stop trying to pass the buck onto other individuals, who possibly  they did commit the same things, maybe even more heinous than what hes done.

tarana burke, the founder of the #metoo movement, agreed with kemplin, saying, i wish that he would be more direct and have an apology. i think this really about accountability. and as stephanie just expressed, its not justice unless theres actual accountability. him stepping down, you know, means something. it does make a statement about whats tolerable in his position, in his role as a leader. but in a more personal way, this is about what he did to people, an interpersonal exchange with what he did to people, and an apology and having some accountability for that behavior would be better.
