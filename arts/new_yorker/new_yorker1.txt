is simple: not at all the life you had before.

you study latin, catullus poems daily, one in which

he calls his penis sparrow (or sparrow penis),

a finger held to the tiny beak.

and where is afterlife? in these vocatives? the wild

declensions refuse to stay inside your wobbly brain,

like birds you thought would never peck you

or anyone else; they scatter like the friends

you count on all ten, wounded fingers.

what about that hawk, red-tailed, you observed

perching high in the walmart garden center

up in the scaffolded ceiling above the compost?

what plumage, what hungry curve of beak!

there, amongst the pinwheels, plastic watering cans,

the detritus of manufacturing plants in china,

where billions of people carry out the pact to rape

the earth for your comforts, the hawk is calm,

predatory, for what he wanted to eat might scurry

from behind the fireworks display, over spades

and past your cart full of organics, or he might

seek you if you were smaller. and you are.
