the road wasnt as hazardous then,

when id walk to the steel guardrail,

lean my bendy girl body over, and stare

at the cold creek water. in a wet spring,

the waterd run clear and high, minnows

mouthing the sand and silt, a crawdad

shadowed by the shores long reeds.

i could stare for hours, something

always new in each watery wedge

a bottle top, a mans black boot, a toad.

once, a raccoons carcass half under

the overpass, half out, slowly decayed

over months. id check on him each day,

watching until the white bones of his hand

were totally skinless and seemed to reach

out toward the sun as it hit the water,

showing all five of his sweet tensile fingers

still clinging. i dont think i worshipped

him, his deadness, but i liked the evidence

of him, how it felt like a job to daily

take note of his shifting into the sand.
