it can be hard to just shut up and have a good time in new york, where theres always the chance that a better version of whatever youre doing is right around the corner. so it might be tempting to dismiss this new riff on the japanese speakeasy, which is situated in the basement of airs, a bar that primarily serves champagne. down a flight of stairs, for fifty dollars a head, guests are seated in a snug shoji-screen-lined room under a canopy of cherry blossoms for a two-hour listening session inspired by the vinyl bars of japan, which are known to be sternno requests, no chattering. but tokyo record bar ditches authenticity for accessibility. patrons jot down requests from a preselected index of crowd-pleasers (just a friend, jolene, no sleep till brooklyn) and an amiable d.j. arranges them into a soundtrack for a well-paced stream of izakaya-inflected bites, like caviar sushi and agedashi maitake mushrooms. the experience isnt likely to impress weeaboos or vinyl obsessives, but cocktails like the complex miso dark and stormy (shochu, miso, yuzu, cynar) and the breezily tart rose spritz (umeshu ros sake, yuzu, sparkling yuzu sake) are delicious, and its difficult not to be charmed by the attempt to create intimacy among eighteen strangers on a weeknight. on a recent thursday, a dashing couple sang along to bennie and the jets, while another, on vacation from texas, bantered with cooks in the open kitchen. (we saw this place on olivia wildes instagram and made a reservation.) after patrons settled up, the hostess announced a parting gift inspired by the inevitable last stop after small-portion omakase. were going to save you time and go ahead and serve you a piece of pizza, she said. a hush fell over the room as each diner devoured a perfectly greasy slice off a paper plate.
